We suggest that the shared volumetric reductions in the insula and STG might reflect communication deficits and infrequent participation in mentally or socially stimulating activities, which have been described as risk factors for both MCI and MDD. We also suggest that the disease-specific structural changes might reflect the disease-specific symptoms such as poor integration of emotional information, feelings of helplessness and worthlessness, and anhedonia in MDD. These findings could contribute to better understanding of the origins of MDD-MCI comorbidity and facilitate development of early interventions. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMajor depressive disorder (MDD), a heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder associated with abnormalities in psychomotor, cognitive and affective functioning, is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease ( ). Longitudinal studies revealed that, compared to healthy controls, MDD patients have higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the transitional stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia, characterized by slight impairment in cognitive functioning but preserved ability to function in daily life ( ,  ,  ; H\u00e9bert  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). Data from Cardiovascular Health Study demonstrated that severity of depressive symptoms predicted diagnosis of MCI 6\u202fyears later ( ). Further research showed that history of depression approximately doubled one\u2019s risk of subsequent dementia in general ( ) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in particular ( ). A\u00a0recent behavioral   meta  -analysis by   supported this higher risk of dementia in MDD patients vs. a control group and pointed out that this effect was particularly pronounced in those who did not use anti-depressant medication. Consistently, patients with MCI or dementia had higher risk of depression than healthy controls ( ,  ). \n\nLiterature suggests that affective problems over the life course might be associated with a decline in cognitive state even prior to the onset of cognitive impairment. While some studies did not find any relationship between affective problems and decline in cognitive state ( ,  ,  ,  ), a majority of studies found such significant associations ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and it has been proposed that affective problems might be related to accelerated cognitive aging ( ,  ). Moreover, a\u00a0recent systematic review of 34 longitudinal studies focused on the link between depression and decline in cognitive function such as memory loss, executive function and information processing speed over time and found that people with depression experienced a\u00a0greater decline in cognitive state in older adulthood than those without depression ( ). Symptoms of cognitive impairment, including worse memory, psychomotor speed, attention, visual learning as well as worse executive functioning, were observed also in patients in the first episode of depression ( ,  ). The largest effects were present in attention and executive function and these symptoms persisted also during remission when subjects did not experience mood problems but their performance still differed from that of healthy controls ( ,  ). \n\nWhile the epidemiological evidence of the longitudinal comorbidity of depression and cognitive impairment described above is well established, the underlying mechanisms explaining the link between affective problems and cognitive decline are not very well understood ( ). According to  , depression-associated cerebrovascular disease and glucocorticoid neurotoxicity may lead to lower cognitive reserve and contribute to accelerated cognitive decline. It has been suggested that alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and somatostatin (SST), signalling neuropeptides important for neuronal survival and function, and BDNF-related genes might contribute to the comorbidity between depression and age-related disorders ( ). However, it is unclear how these purported mechanisms may translate into unique and overlapping macrostructural abnormalities associated with MDD and age-related cognitive impairment. \n\nImaging studies have typically examined major depressive disorder (MDD) ( ,  ,  ) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) ( ,  ) separately and/or in small samples and thus were not able to identify a structural brain signature common to these conditions that may illuminate potentially targetable shared biological mechanisms. To fill this gap, we performed a\u00a0  meta  -analysis of structural brain imaging studies of individuals with MDD, MCI, and their respective age-matched controls to identify neural correlates which are shared between MDD and MCI. We also aimed to identify the disease-specific neural correlates and discuss how these shared and unique neural correlates might reflect the comorbidity of these disorders and the disease-specific symptomatology, respectively. Based on the research by  , which suggested that decreased grey matter volume in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex might lead to cognitive dysfunction in depression, we hypothesized that both MCI and MDD patients might show lower grey matter volume (GMV) in these areas than healthy controls. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nOur study was carried out in compliance with Items for systematic reviews and   meta  -analyses (PRISMA), an evidence-based minimum set of items for reporting in   meta  -analysis ( ). \n\n### Study selection \n  \nAn initial search in the Web of Science and PubMed databases was done on 1.2.2020\u00a0using the following query: ((((depress* OR MDD) OR (\u201cMCI\u201d OR \u201cmild cognitive impairment\u201d)) AND (VBM OR MRI OR GM OR \u201cgrey matter volume\u201d))). This search returned 10 054 English articles in the Web of Science database and 10 017 English articles in the PubMed database.\u00a0After removing duplicates, we screened the titles and abstracts of all remaining studies and identified 561 relevant research articles (see  ). These 561 research articles were assessed by the first author as well as two additional independent co-workers for the following inclusion criteria: (1) studies in English language, (2) studies in adult humans diagnosed with either MDD or MCI (but without a\u00a0comorbidity) compared with age-matched healthy controls, (3) voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and (4) whole brain analysis reporting peaks in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach stereotactic space (TAL). In the case of unclear articles, there was always a mutual consultation followed by a subsequent decision on the relevance of the article. In case of missing data, we contacted the relevant authors via email and if we did not receive necessary information, we excluded those articles as inappropriate. All inclusion criteria were met by a total of 48 articles which we included in the   meta  -analysis (see  ). Characteristics of these 48 studies MDD (n\u202f=\u202f37) and MCI (n\u202f=\u202f11) are provided in  ,  , respectively.   \nPRISMA flow diagram representing selection procedure in   meta  -analysis \n    \nCharacteristics of the 37 MDD studies included in   meta  -analysis \n      \nCharacteristics of the 11 MCI studies included in   meta  -analysis \n    \n\n\n### Meta-analytic neuroimaging methods \n  \nThe   meta  -analysis was conducted using SDM-PSI (Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images) software, version 6.21 ( ,  ). The method description and tutorial have been previously published ( ,  ) and it is also available online (www.sdmproject.com). In short, SDM-PSI uses reported peak coordinates and t values as an input to generate multiple imputations of study images. The SDM-PSI then performs subject-based permutation testing to create (1) a map of effect sizes (Hedge\u2019s g) with positive and negative differences and (2) a map of variance, derived from the effect sizes and the sample sizes in the study. The exact effect size is calculated only in voxels containing a peak; the effect size for the remaining voxels is estimated depending on the distance to close peaks by means of an unnormalised Gaussian kernel. Finally, subject images are imputed for each study, followed by subject-based standard permutation test, which allows the use of standard voxel-wise tests. We used the recommended Gaussian kernel with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20\u202fmm and 2\u202fmm voxel size, which provides the optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity ( ). For the permutation parameters, we applied default 50 imputations of study images and 1000 permutation of subject images for each study ( ). \n\nWe conducted two separate mean analyses, one for MDD vs healthy controls (HC) contrast and second for MCI vs HC contrast, each with age as a covariate. We applied voxel-level (height) threshold of p\u202f<\u202f0.025 (0.05/2 for both positive and negative contrasts) with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) for multiple comparisons and a minimal cluster extent of 10 voxels and a cluster-level (extent) threshold of 10 voxels. All results are reported in MNI coordinate system. \n\n\n### Overlap analyses \n  \nWe computed overlap between results of the two mean analyses (MDD and MCI) with SDM-PSI multimodal   meta  -analysis utility ( ). This method allows the original p-values of individual   meta  -analyses to be estimated with some degree of error and can eventually show results in regions that were close to significance which gives a more realistic approximation than simple overlap. \n\n\n### Complementary analyses \n  \nHeterogeneity analysis was used to assess which brain regions found by our mean analysis showed unexplained variability across the studies. SDM calculates Q statistic based on effect-size variance between studies in a given area. The heterogeneity is tested for significance by determining if the observed between-study variance for a given area is greater than the variance resulting from sampling error alone. The heterogeneity values are reported as standard z values in SDM, presented together with variance for each peak in  ,  .   \nMeta-analytic results \u2013 VBM differences between MDD patients and healthy controls \n      \nMeta-analytic results \u2013 VBM differences between MCI patients and healthy controls \n    \n\nThe potential bias was assessed by Egger tests ( ) reported in Supplementary Table\u202f1S. \n\nTo investigate confound of medication we repeated the analysis with subset of MDD studies which included only medication free patients (n\u202f=\u202f15). Therefore, we conducted mean analysis for medication free MDD vs HC contrast and subsequently we computed the overlap of medication free MDD and MCI mean analyses. Detailed results of analysis with medication free subset are reported in Supplementary Tables\u202f2S and 3S. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### MDD patients vs. Healthy controls \n  \nThe contrast between the MDD group (n\u202f=\u202f1364) and HC (n\u202f=\u202f1464) showed volumetric reductions in frontal, temporal, parietal as well as occipital regions (see  ). In particular, lower volume was found in an extensive cluster with peak in left striatum, but extending to other subcortical structures (right striatum and hippocampus), anterior and middle cingulate cortex, insula, frontal, temporal and occipital gyri. Decreased volume in MDD was also found in a cluster extending to left superior temporal lobe, insula and inferior frontal gyrus and in another cluster extending to left inferior parietal lobe and supramarginal gyrus. Remaining smaller clusters with reduced volume in MDD were found in left cerebellum, fusiform gyrus, postcentral gyrus and left and right middle frontal gyri. Detailed description of these volumetric reductions in MDD as well as statistics are provided in  . There were no regions with larger volume in the MDD vs. control group. The Egger test was not significant for any of the clusters, suggesting no detectable publication bias.   \nRegions of GM volume decreases underlying MDD and MCI symptomatology. Shared regions are depicted in green, MDD-specific regions in blue, and MCI-specific regions in yellow. (R: right; L: left; HC: healthy controls; MCI: mild cognitive impairment; MDD: major depressive disorder; g: gyrus; Voxel-wise threshold p\u202f<\u202f0.005 uncorrected; minimum cluster extent 10 voxels, except for multimodal   meta  -analysis (p\u202f<\u202f0.0025)) \n  \n\n\n### MCI patients vs. Healthy controls \n  \nThe contrast between the MCI group (n\u202f=\u202f407) and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f392) showed reduced volume in a single cluster which included right insula, rolandic operculum and superior temporal lobe. Detailed description of volumetric reductions in MCI as well as statistics are provided in  . There were no regions with larger volume in the MCI vs. control group. The Egger test was not significant for the single cluster, suggesting no detectable publication bias. \n\n\n### Overlap analysis \n  \nMultimodal   meta  -analysis of overlapping volume reductions in MDD and MCI identified 3 clusters. The most extensive cluster included right hemisphere insula, middle and superior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, inferior frontal gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Smaller cluster in left hemisphere included insula, superior temporal gyrus, temporal pole and inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, the smallest cluster included left thalamus (see  ). Detailed description and the relevant statistics are provided in  .   \nMeta-analytic results \u2013 Shared volumetric decreases underlying MDD and MCI symptomatology \n    \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe performed a\u00a0  meta  -analysis of 48 voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of major depressive disorder (MDD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and their respective age-matched controls, and demonstrated that MDD and MCI patients had shared volumetric reductions in number of regions including the insula, superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus. We suggest that these shared volumetric decreases might, in part, explain the epidemiological evidence of the longitudinal comorbidity between MDD and MCI ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and that the disease-specific structural changes might reflect the disease-specific symptoms. \n\nSpecifically, since the insula is involved in socio-emotional processing, emotional experience and cognitive functions ( ), and the superior temporal gyrus (STG) is part of a language network, we suggest that the decreased volume of insula and STG might reflect communication deficits and infrequent participation in mentally or socially stimulating activities, which have been described as risk factors for both MCI and MDD ( ,  ). These deficits in engaging in mentally or socially stimulating activities and communication among the MDD and MCI patients are then reflected also by shared volumetric decreases in the subcortical structures, including the amygdala, which plays a key role in emotion processing ( ), the hippocampus, which is critical for memory ( ), and the thalamus, which relays information between subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex ( ). \n\nOur finding of the shared volumetric reductions in MDD and MCI are consistent with previous findings in the respective groups of patients. For example, smaller insula in both MDD and MCI patients might reflect deficits in emotion processing, previously described in both MDD ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and MCI ( ,  ). Smaller insula was also associated with worse sustained attention, general cognitive performance and executive function in patients with depression ( ). Our finding of smaller hippocampus in both MDD and MCI is also consistent with number of studies on MDD ( ,  ) and MCI ( ). It is also consistent with   who examined relationships between depressive symptoms, hippocampal volume and cognitive decline and suggested that depression might initiate a glucocorticoid cascade that damages the hippocampus, which is critical or formation of new memories, and thus increases the risk of depressed individuals for cognitive decline. More broadly, our findings are also consistent with a   meta  -analysis of social cognition studies across 30 clinical conditions including both psychiatric and neurological disorders, which concluded that social cognitive dysfunction might be a shared transdiagnostic issue ( ). \n\nThe disease-specific structural changes might then reflect the disease-specific symptoms. For example, the MDD-specific reductions in volume of frontal regions might reflect poor integration of emotional information ( ) and feelings of helplessness and worthlessness ( ). Smaller volume of the striatum, which is a key structure for reward processing (Baez-Mendoza & Schultz), might reflect the MDD-specific symptoms of anhedonia. While the MDD-specific reductions were relatively widespread, the MCI-specific reductions were much more focal, located primarily in the insula and rolandic operculum, and thus possibly reflecting more pronounced deficits in cognition and executive function ( ) and deficits in interoceptive awareness and bodily self-consciousness ( ), respectively. \n\nMCI is defined as greater than normal age-related changes in cognition ( ) and recent research demonstrated that brains of MCI patients are 3\u202fyears older than the brains of healthy controls ( ). Worse cognition ( ) and older structural brain age relative to chronological age, ranging from\u202f+0.8 to\u202f+4\u202fyears ( ,  ,  ,  ), were also reported in depression. The hypothesis of accelerated aging in depression has been investigated also at the molecular level ( ,  ). MDD patients were found to have shorter telomeres ( ), age-dependent changes in gene function ( ), accelerated age-dependent changes in DNA methylation ( ), or raised and dysregulated levels of proteins characteristic for cellular aging ( ). Future research might test whether the comorbidity of MDD and MCI might be explained by accelerated aging. Future research might also collect longitudinal data to study these changes over time. \n\nThe possible impact of sex on the alterations in gray matter volume could not be assessed based on the information provided in these 48 structural magnetic resonance studies and should be considered in future research. Given the currently available literature, we were also not able to compare the MCI patients with and without depression to MDD patients without cognitive impairment and normal controls. Further, given the fact that we performed a   meta  -analysis of cross-sectional studies, we are not able to determine whether active engagement in mentally and socially stimulating activities is the cause of atrophy in the insula and STG or whether the atrophy occurs first and results in the lesser engagement in these activities. It is also important to note that while healthy controls were age-matched with the MDD and MCI patients, the mean age of MDD patients was younger than that of MCI patients. To correct for this difference in age, our analyses used age as a covariate. Still, due to the design of our study, there is a possibility that age might have influenced the shared decreases in GM volume between the MDD and MCI patients and their controls. Finally, the MCI group was considerably smaller than the MDD group and thus the reliability of MCI results might be limited. \n\nDespite these limitations, our   meta  -analysis of 48 structural magnetic resonance imaging studies suggests that the shared volumetric decreases might, at least in part, underlie the comorbidity of mild cognitive impairment and depression. Considering the rapid demographic aging occurring in populations worldwide, the number of people struggling with comorbid MDD-MCI is likely to increase, and thus early interventions targeting mentally and socially stimulating activities, which would stimulate communication and the relevant brain regions should be developed. \n\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest \n  \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8473769, "text_md5": "f440745ca03bb17364ffc356aafcdafc", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 105], "journal": [106, 121], "publication_year": [123, 127], "title": [138, 237], "keywords": [251, 420], "abstract": [433, 2219], "body": [2228, 21539]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 34560530, "doi": "10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102830", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473769", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8473769"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473769\">8473769</a>", "list_title": "PMC8473769  Cognitive impairment and depression: Meta-analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging studies"}

A comprehensive search was performed in four databases to retrieve studies of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients that have reported the diagnostic ability of FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI for detecting metastasis and the proportion of patients whose management was changed by its results. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting metastasis and the proportion of patients with management changes were pooled using a random-effects model. A total of 10 studies were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting lymph node metastasis were 0.55 and 0.94, respectively, while the pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting distant metastasis were 0.80 and 1.00, respectively. The areas under the summarized receiver operating characteristic curves for detecting lymph node and distant metastasis were 0.88 and 0.92, respectively. The pooled proportion of patients with management changes was 19%. FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI showed high diagnostic accuracy for detecting lymph node and distant metastasis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients, and the use of these imaging tools led to management changes in a significant portion of these patients. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nPancreatic cancer is notorious for its extremely poor prognosis [ ]. A previous study reported the 5-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer to be only 9%, and it is the seventh leading cause of cancer death in both men and women worldwide [ , ]. The only potential curative treatment for pancreatic cancer is radical surgical resection [ ]. However, according to several recent reviews, at the time of initial staging work-up, distant metastatic lesions are found in over 50% of pancreatic cancer patients and only 20% of patients have resectable disease [ , ]. In order to choose the most suitable treatment and to prevent unnecessary surgery, accurate tumor staging is essential for patients with pancreatic cancer [ , ]. Therefore, various anatomical imaging modalities including contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasonography are used in the initial staging work-up of pancreatic cancer [ ]. \n\nIn addition to anatomical imaging examinations, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a radiotracer preferentially taken up by malignant cells, is currently used for the evaluation of pancreatic cancer [ ]. In previous studies of pancreatic cancer, FDG PET showed significant clinical value for differentiating malignant pancreatic lesions from benign lesions, detecting metastatic lesions, predicting prognosis after treatment, and assessing cancer recurrence [ , , , , ]. Considering the high prevalence of distant metastasis in patients with pancreatic cancer, it is reasonable to assume that FDG PET could play a significant role in the staging work-up of pancreatic cancer; however, there remain controversies in defining its roll [ , , , , ]. Furthermore, previous meta-analyses of the role of FDG PET in staging pancreatic cancer consisted mainly of studies that used a PET scanner [ , ]. With the advancement of medical technology, a dedicated PET/CT or PET/MRI scanner is more commonly used in clinical practice currently, rather than a PET scanner [ , ]. In FDG PET images, several intra-abdominal organs, such as the bowel and liver, can exhibit physiological FDG uptake, which can lead to uncertain diagnoses and high false-positive rates in cases using interpretation of stand-alone PET images for staging [ ]. On the other hand, PET/CT and PET/MRI are known to improve lesion identification and localization with the aid of anatomical information provided by CT and MRI images, thereby increasing diagnostic accuracy [ , ]. Therefore, a comprehensive review of studies using FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI, rather than PET alone, is required to establish their role for staging pancreatic cancer in current clinical practice. \n\nIn the present study, we systematically reviewed the available literature and performed a meta-analysis to investigate the diagnostic ability of staging FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI for detecting lymph node and distant metastasis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We also conducted a meta-analysis of the impact of staging FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI on management in those patients. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \nThe methodological approach of this meta-analysis complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies [ ]. All processes regarding study eligibility assessment, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment were independently and repeatedly performed by two independent reviewers (J.W.L., J.Y.C.). Disagreement was resolved via discussion and consensus among the reviewers. \n\n### 2.1. Literature Search \n  \nA systematic literature search was performed in four different bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and KoreaMed) for all studies published from 1 January 2000 to 6 November 2019 using combinations of the following keywords: \u201cpancreatic neoplasm\u201d or \u201cpancreas tumor\u201d or \u201cpancreas cancer\u201d or \u201cpancreas carcinoma\u201d or \u201cpancreas adenocarcinoma\u201d or \u201cpancreas malignancy\u201d AND \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d or \u201cPET\u201d or \u201cPET/CT\u201d or \u201cPET-CT\u201d or \u201cPET/MRI\u201d or \u201cPET-MRI\u201d AND \u201cstaging\u201d or \u201cstage\u201d or \u201cdiagnosis\u201d or \u201cdetect\u201d or \u201cmetastasis\u201d AND \u201cdiagnostic accuracy\u201d or \u201csensitivity\u201d or \u201cspecificity\u201d or \u201creceiver operating characteristic\u201d or \u201cROC curve\u201d or \u201carea under the curve\u201d or \u201cAUC\u201d or \u201cadded value\u201d or \u201cdiagnostic yield\u201d or \u201cpredict\u201d or \u201caccuracy\u201d. No language restriction was applied for the literature search. In addition, reference lists of retrieved studies were also screened to avoid missing eligible studies. \n\n\n### 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria \n  \nAll relevant literature underwent evaluation for eligibility according to inclusion criteria based on the patient/intervention/comparator/outcome/study (PICOS) approach [ ], as follows: (1) individuals with newly diagnosed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma as the patients; (2) FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI as the intervention; (3) no comparator; (4) the diagnostic performance for staging pancreatic cancer, confirmed by histopathological evaluation or imaging studies, and the proportion of patients with management changes as the outcomes; and (5) original articles as the study type. The exclusion criteria were as follows: studies that (1) enrolled any patients with malignant pancreatic diseases other than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, such as neuroendocrine tumors, metastasis, or lymphoma; (2) used PET, not PET/CT, or PET/MRI as the intervention; (3) provided insufficient information for calculating true-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative rates for estimating diagnostic performance during per-patient analysis or for calculating the proportion of patients with management changes; (4) were publication types other than original articles, including case reports, reviews, letters, editorials, and conference abstracts; (5) were in vitro or animal studies; (6) had study populations that overlapped with other literature; (7) were published in languages other than English or Korean; or (8) were not available in full text. \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment \n  \nThe following information was extracted from each of the included studies: the first author, publication year, country, study design, number and characteristics (age, sex, and enrollment criteria) of patients, details of the intervention techniques (imaging modality and imaging analytical method), reference standard, and outcomes. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool [ ]. The QUADAS-2 tool consists of 14 questions with 4 key domains\u2014patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. Each question was answered with \u201cyes\u201d for a low risk of bias, \u201cno\u201d for a high risk of bias, and \u201cunclear\u201d if insufficient data were reported [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.4. Statistical Analysis \n  \nThe primary outcome of this meta-analysis was the diagnostic accuracies of FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI for detecting lymph node metastasis (N staging) and distant metastasis (M staging) in patients with pancreatic cancer. The secondary outcome was the impact of FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI on patient management, as assessed by calculating the proportion of patients whose therapeutic plan was changed due to the PET/CT or PET/MRI findings. \n\nWith the data extracted from the included studies, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) in detecting lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis were calculated by using a bivariate meta-analysis method with a random-effects model. Furthermore, summarized receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were generated for evaluating the diagnostic abilities of PET/CT and PET/MRI using the calculated area under the curves (AUC). The proportion of patients with management changes was calculated for each study, and the results were meta-analytically pooled using a random-effects model. The I  statistic was used to assess the heterogeneity among the included studies. An I  value lies from 0% to 100%, with a value of >50% suggesting substantial heterogeneity [ ]. In meta-analyses with an I  > 50%, subgroup analyses were further performed to investigate the sources of heterogeneity; investigated subgroups were country (Asia vs. non-Asia), study design (prospective vs. retrospective), and analytical method of PET images (qualitative analysis vs. quantitative analysis). Publication bias was assessed using Deek\u2019s funnel plot and Egger\u2019s test. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata software version 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Study Selection and Characteristics \n  \nThe process of study selection is depicted in  . In the systematic literature search, a total of 1457 articles were initially retrieved ( ). After excluding 384 duplicated articles and 1002 articles based on title and abstract screening, 71 articles were potentially eligible. On full-text assessment for eligibility, 61 studies were excluded; hence, 10 studies comprising 852 patients were finally included in our meta-analysis. \n\nThe characteristics of the 10 enrolled studies are shown in  . All included studies were published in English; three studies were prospective [ , , ], while the remaining seven were retrospective [ , , , , , , ]. The number of enrolled patients in each study ranged from 37 to 261, with two studies showing enrollment of >100 patients [ , ]. Of the 10 included studies, only one was a multi-center study [ ], while the remaining were single-center studies. As for imaging methods, one study evaluated the diagnostic performance of PET/MRI [ ], while in all other included studies the diagnostic ability of PET/CT was assessed. For the imaging analytical method, six studies used visual assessment for determining lesions with positive FDG uptake [ , , , , , ], whereas four studies performed quantitative analysis using the cut-off standardized uptake value (SUV) of 2.5 [ , ], 3.0 [ ], or 3.5 [ ] for determining malignant involvement. \n\n\n### 3.2. Quality Assessment \n  \nThe methodological quality assessment of the included studies is shown in   ( ). In the domain of patient selection, six studies were judged to have high or unclear risk of bias, which was mainly due to providing insufficient information regarding consecutive enrollment of patients [ , , , , , ]. For the reference standard, three studies were judged to have high or unclear risk of bias because the blinding method was not used in interpreting the references standard results [ , , ]. For the flow and timing, the major weaknesses were the lack of information regarding the interval between the index tests and reference standard and the lack of a uniform reference test for enrolled patients. Meanwhile, only a single study was judged to be high risk with regard to the concerns about applicability in the domain of patient selection [ ]. Furthermore, a single study was considered to have unclear risk with regard to applicability concerns in both the index test [ ] and reference standard [ ] domains. \n\n\n### 3.3. Diagnostic Performance of PET/CT and PET/MRI for Detection of Lymph Node and Distant Metastases \n  \nSix studies with a total of 357 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were included in the meta-analysis of using FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI for diagnosing lymph node metastasis [ , , , , , ]. The pooled results from these studies demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI for detecting lymph node metastasis were 0.55 (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.38\u20130.72) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.81\u20130.98), respectively ( A). Furthermore, the pooled PLR, NLR, and DOR were 9.87 (95% CI: 2.55\u201338.25), 0.47 (95% CI: 0.31\u20130.72), and 2.11 (95% CI: 1.40\u20133.20), respectively, with an AUC of SROC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85\u20130.90;  A). Of the six included studies, one study evaluated the diagnostic ability of PET/MRI [ ], which showed a similar sensitivity (0.40; 95% CI: 0.12\u20130.74) and specificity (1.00; 95% CI: 0.29\u20131.00) to those obtained from the studies evaluating PET/CT. \n\nSeven studies with a total of 296 patients provided data regarding the diagnostic ability of FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI for detecting distant metastasis [ , , , , , , ]. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI for diagnosing distant metastasis were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.67\u20130.89) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.89\u20131.00), respectively ( B). The pooled PLR, NLR, and DOR were 215.30 (95% CI: 7.39\u20136273.09), 0.20 (95% CI: 0.12\u20130.34), and 1084.20 (95% CI: 33.92\u201334,658.01), respectively, with an AUC of SROC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90\u20130.94;  B). The study which evaluated PET/MRI [ ] found a sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.19\u20130.99) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.75\u20131.00), respectively, for detecting distant metastasis, which were similar to the results of other studies evaluating PET/CT. \n\n\n### 3.4. Management Changes Following PET/CT \n  \nSix studies with a total of 650 patients assessed the proportions of patients who underwent management changes following FDG PET/CT staging and compared it to that of conventional staging [ , , , , , ]. All six studies performed PET/CT for initial staging of pancreatic cancer. The pooled percentage of patients who underwent management changes following FDG PET/CT was 19% (95% CI: 5\u201334%,  ). In all six studies, the most common reason of management change was identifying unknown metastatic lesions by PET/CT. Additionally, PET/CT also changed the management plan by detecting secondary primary malignancies and ruling out metastasis of lesions found on other imaging modalities. \n\nAmong the six studies, two prospective studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PET/CT in staging of pancreatic cancer [ , ]. In a study by Heinrich et al. [ ], PET/CT was cost saving by avoiding patients from unnecessary surgery, showing cost-savings of USD 1066 per patient. In another study by Ghaneh et al. [ ], PET/CT was both less costly and more effective when compared to contrast-enhanced CT. A subgroup of pancreatic cancer patients with resection showed the most cost-effective results, showing cost-savings of GBP 1542 per patient. \n\n\n### 3.5. Heterogeneity Analysis \n  \nThere was substantial heterogeneity in the sensitivity for lymph node metastasis (  p   < 0.001; I  = 77.1; 95% CI: 58.8\u201395.4%;  A), the specificity for distant metastasis (  p   < 0.001; I  = 87.5; 95% CI: 79.7\u201395.4%;  B), and the proportion of patients who underwent management changes following FDG PET/CT staging ((  p   < 0.001; I  = 96.3; 95% CI: 91.1\u201398.7%;  ) among the included studies. The specificity for lymph node metastasis (  p   = 0.08; I  = 49.1%; 95% CI: 2.0\u201396.1%;  A) and the sensitivity for distant metastasis (  p   = 0.05; I  = 52.9%; 95% CI: 12.7\u201393.1%;  B) showed borderline significance with regard to the I  statistic. No significant publication bias was shown for all meta-analyses in the current study (  p   = 0.80 for diagnostic ability in detecting lymph node metastasis;   p   = 0.81 for diagnostic ability in detecting distant metastasis;   p   = 0.31 for proportion of patients who underwent management changes;  ). \n\n\n### 3.6. Subgroup Analysis \n  \nSubgroup analyses was performed based on the country, study design, and the analytical method of each study ( ). For the diagnostic ability of FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI for lymph node metastasis, because there was only one study performed in a non-Asian country and only one with a prospective study design, we performed a subgroup analysis only based on the analytical method. On this subgroup analysis, studies that used qualitative analytical methods showed a higher sensitivity for detecting both lymph node metastasis (0.64 vs. 0.40, respectively) and distant metastasis (0.84 vs. 0.64, respectively) than those that used quantitative analytical methods (  p   < 0.05 for both). Meanwhile, all analyzed factors failed to explain the heterogeneity in the specificity for detecting lymph node and distant metastasis. In subgroup analysis of the proportion of subjects who underwent management changes, studies in non-Asian countries, with a prospective study design, and with qualitative analytical methods revealed higher proportions of patients with management changes following PET/CT (28.2 vs. 9.8%, respectively, for country; 39.9 vs. 10.2%, respectively, for study design; 25.5 vs. 14.8%, respectively, for analytical method) than those in Asian countries, with a retrospective design, and with quantitative analytical methods (  p   < 0.05 for all). \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn patients with pancreatic cancer, contrast-enhanced CT is the preferred primary imaging modality for the initial evaluation [ ]. Additionally, MRI and endoscopic ultrasound have been commonly used to delineate primary tumors, to evaluate blood vessel involvement, and to detect metastatic lesions [ , ]. Although most pancreatic cancer lesions showed increased FDG uptake, the potential benefits of FDG PET/CT in staging pancreatic cancer remains contentious [ , , ]. In previous studies, staging FDG PET/CT showed a high diagnostic accuracy for detecting metastatic lesions of pancreatic cancer [ , , , ], and it has been recommended in patients with localized disease for detecting metastatic lesions in guidelines from the Japan Pancreas Society, the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [ , , ]. By contrast, because of the relatively small proportion of patients in whom additional metastatic lesions were found only by FDG PET/CT, other studies have suggested that PET/CT has a limited role in the staging work-up of pancreatic cancer [ , ]. In guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society for Medical Oncology, the use of FDG PET/CT is not routinely recommended for the management of pancreatic cancer patients [ , ]. In the present meta-analysis, FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI showed only moderate sensitivity for detecting lymph node metastasis. Meanwhile, PET/CT and PET/MRI demonstrated high specificity for detecting lymph node metastasis and high sensitivity and specificity for detecting distant metastasis, showing high AUC of the SROC values for both lymph node and distant metastasis. Furthermore, the findings from FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI led to management changes in 19% of pancreatic cancer patients mainly by identifying unknown metastatic lesions, and PET/CT was cost-effective for pancreatic cancer staging with cost-savings of more than USD 1000 per patient. The results of our study suggest that FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI could be a valuable diagnostic imaging modality for initial staging in patients with pancreatic cancer and could have a significant impact on determining therapeutic plans for these patients. Considering that, in the included studies, FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI both had a high diagnostic accuracy for distant metastasis, and most patients who underwent management changes following FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI were upstaged to stage IV [ , , , , , ], FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI should be routinely recommended in patients with localized pancreatic cancer who plan to receive curative treatment. \n\nIn previous meta-analyses of studies of pancreatic cancer patients, the sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET and PET/CT were 32\u201367% and 75\u201381%, respectively, for identifying lymph node metastasis and 57\u201367% and 96\u2013100%, respectively, for distant metastasis [ , ]. Since those meta-analyses mainly included studies that utilized a PET scanner or studies that enrolled patients with malignant pancreatic diseases other than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [ , , ], it is difficult to make a direct comparison of our results with the results of these previous meta-analyses. However, our results demonstrated higher specificity for detecting lymph node metastasis and higher sensitivity for detecting distant metastasis with FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI than the results of those previous meta-analyses [ , ]. Given that anatomical information gleaned from CT images from PET/CT scans can increase the specificity for lymph node staging and the sensitivity for detecting metastatic lesions [ , , , ], these results may suggest an incremental increase in the diagnostic value of PET/CT and PET/MRI compared with PET alone. \n\nOur meta-analyses found substantial heterogeneity across the included studies. Notably, in subgroup analyses performed to investigate the source of this heterogeneity, the method of analyzing PET images was found to be a significant factor for heterogeneity in all meta-analyses. Qualitative analysis is subjective and known to be dependent on the clinical experience of the reader, which might lead to significant inter-reader discrepancies [ , , ]. Hence, quantitative analysis using SUV has been widely used for objective assessment of malignant diseases and has shown comparable results to those of qualitative analysis [ , , ]. However, the results of our subgroup analysis revealed that studies that used qualitative analytical methods showed significantly higher sensitivity for lymph node and distant metastasis and a higher proportion of patients with management changes than studies using quantitative methods. This might be due to the different cut-off values used in the individual studies that utilized quantitative analysis, as there is no determined cut-off SUV for defining metastatic lesions [ ]. Further studies would be needed to clarify the effects of analytical methods on PET/CT and PET/MRI results. Another potential source of the heterogeneity between studies for the proportion of subjects who underwent management changes was study design. In the subgroup analysis, the prospective studies had significantly higher proportions of patients with management changes than the retrospective ones. Given that retrospective studies use the data that might be collected for another objective and are often assumed to have more bias than prospective ones [ ], this result might imply the underestimation of the effect of FDG PET/CT on therapeutic planning in the retrospective studies. Additionally, variations in the country where the studies were performed was another potential cause of heterogeneity seen between studies for the proportion of patients who underwent management changes. \n\nThe present analysis had several limitations that need to be addressed. First, the number of studies included in this meta-analysis was relatively small, and most of the included studies were retrospectively performed (7 out of 10 studies) or single-center studies (9 out of 10 studies). Further studies are necessary which include a large number of prospective and multi-center studies. Second, the definition of a positive lesion on PET/CT, as well as reference standards, varied among the included studies which could affect the accuracy of the results. Third, due to insufficient information regarding the stages of those patients who underwent management changes following PET/CT, the pooled proportion of patients with management changes could not be stratified by initial stage. However, given this limitation, our results could support the clinical use of PET/CT in pancreatic cancer irrespective of the initial stage. Fourth, the definition of changes in patient management following PET/CT staging might differ among the enrolled studies. Furthermore, although the diagnostic performance of PET/MRI was similar to that of PET/CT, because only a single study evaluated the diagnostic performance of PET/MRI [ ], we could not perform subgroup analysis to compare diagnostic ability between PET/MRI and PET/CT. Lastly, there was substantial heterogeneity across the studies, and we were unable to find the potential source for the heterogeneity in specificity. Hence, the general application of our pooled results might be limited to specific clinical conditions. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn the present meta-analysis, FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI showed high specificity for detecting lymph node metastasis and high sensitivity and specificity for identifying distant metastasis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI had a significant impact on the management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, with our results showing a pooled proportion of 19% of patients who underwent management changes following imaging. Based on our results, FDG PET/CT and PET/MRI would be considered to be one of the routine imaging examinations used in the staging work-up of pancreatic cancer. However, because of the relatively small number of included studies with substantial heterogeneity among them, further prospective studies with larger populations are needed to further elucidate our results. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7696716, "text_md5": "3774153e9ad447b1cca18c1a0bd799b5", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 69], "journal": [70, 89], "publication_year": [91, 95], "title": [106, 276], "keywords": [290, 386], "abstract": [399, 1888], "body": [1897, 26832]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33202682, "doi": "10.3390/diagnostics10110952", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7696716", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7696716"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7696716\">7696716</a>", "list_title": "PMC7696716  Impact of F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT and PET/MRI on Initial Staging and Changes in Management of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis"}

The scope and status of research using artificial intelligence (AI) on classifying true progression are yet unknown. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify studies that investigated the performance of AI-assisted MRI in classifying true progression after stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery of brain metastasis, published before November 11, 2020. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated using bivariate random-effects modeling. Meta-regression was performed for the identification of factors contributing to the heterogeneity among the studies. We assessed the quality of the studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) criteria and a modified version of the radiomics quality score (RQS). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nSeven studies were included, with a total of 485 patients and 907 tumors. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 77% (95% CI, 70\u201383%) and 74% (64\u201382%), respectively. All 7 studies used radiomics, and none used deep learning. Several covariates including the proportion of lung cancer as the primary site, MR field strength, and radiomics segmentation slice showed a statistically significant association with the heterogeneity. Study quality was overall favorable in terms of the QUADAS-2 criteria, but not in terms of the RQS. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe diagnostic performance of AI-assisted MRI seems yet inadequate to be used reliably in clinical practice. Future studies with improved methodologies and a larger training set are needed. \n\n \n\n# Body\n    Key Points     \nThe performance of AI-assisted MRI seems yet inadequate for use in clinical practice. \n  \nAll studies used radiomics, and none used deep learning. \n  \nQuality and study design of the published literature should be improved. \n      Importance of the Study   \nClassification of true progression after stereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery of brain metastasis is important, as incorrect diagnosis may lead to unnecessary systemic therapy or additional radiation therapy, or invasive biopsy or surgery for a definitive diagnosis. However, such classification is known to be difficult using advanced imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography or MR spectroscopy, as well as conventional MRI. Our study contributes to the knowledge gap regarding the status of research using artificial intelligence on diagnostic task. Our study reviews the methodology and quality of the current studies, offering valuable information for future research. \n \nStereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery, owing to its high efficacy with relatively short treatment time and favorable toxicity profile, is increasingly used for patients with a limited number of brain metastases.  Contrast-enhanced MR imaging remains the modality of choice for follow-up after stereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery (hereinafter, collectively termed as stereotactic radiotherapy) of brain metastasis, as it shows excellent soft-tissue contrast that can delineate structural abnormalities with high resolution. However, new or enlarging lesion on MRI may complicate patient management during follow-up, as such lesion is not always indicative of true progression.  Classification of true progression from nonprogression including radiation necrosis is known to be difficult on conventional MRI. In a previous systematic review,  the pooled sensitivity and specificity of conventional gadolinium MRI across four studies was around 63% and 82%, respectively. Radiation necrosis, which strikingly mimics true progression not only in MR imaging appearance but also in clinical symptoms,  is reported to occur in up to one-fourth of patients after stereotactic radiotherapy.  Incorrect classification of true progression may lead to substantial patient harm, as unnecessary systemic therapy or additional radiation therapy could be administered, or subsequent biopsy or resection may accompany complications such as infection or neurologic deficit. Other advanced imaging modalities such as perfusion MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 18FLT, 18FDG PET, or SPECT  have also been proposed, but to date, none of those has emerged as a standard for diagnosing true progression. \n\nArtificial intelligence (AI), which is receiving increasing attention as a potential game-changer in the field of medical sciences, may be an alternative solution to the diagnostic challenge at hand. For example, automated quantitative analysis of tumor response for glioblastoma on MRI using artificial neural networks showed reliable performance in an independent dataset for external validation.  However, the scope and status of research using AI on classifying true progression are uncertain at this point. Thus, through this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to measure the diagnostic performance of AI-assisted MRI in classifying true progression from nonprogression after radiotherapy of brain metastasis and to identify factors attributable to the heterogeneity in the included studies. \n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nWe adhered to the standard guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). \n\n### Literature Search \n  \nWe performed a literature search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases using the search terms as follows: ((brain metastas*) OR (cerebral metastas*) OR (metastatic brain tumor) OR (intra-axial metastatic tumor)) AND ((automated) OR (computer aided) OR (computer-aided) OR (CAD) OR (radiomic*) OR (texture analysis) OR (deep learning) OR (machine learning) OR (neural network) OR (artificial intelligence)) AND ((gamma-knife) OR (radiotherapy) OR (radiation) OR (radiosurgery)). The literature search was not restricted to any publication date or study setting, and the search was updated until November 11, 2020. The search was limited to publications in English. Bibliographies of the retrieved studies were manually cross-checked to identify any study meeting the inclusion criteria but were not retrieved using our search terms. \n\n\n### Inclusion Criteria \n  \nInclusion criteria for the enrollment of studies were as follows: (1) involved patients who received stereotactic radiotherapy for clinically or pathologically diagnosed brain metastasis, (2) used MRI with the aid of AI as the index test (hereinafter, AI-assisted MRI), (3) purposed to show the diagnostic performance of the index test in classifying (ie, either prediction or differentiation) true progression from nonprogression, and (4) provided the information necessary for the reconstruction of 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables. The term \u201cnonprogression\u201d refers collectively to treatment response any other than true progression, including radiation necrosis. \n\n\n### Exclusion Criteria \n  \nThe exclusion criteria for the enrollment of studies were as follows: (1) case reports or series including less than ten patients; (2) conference abstracts, editorials, letters, consensus statements, guidelines, or review articles; (3) studies with, or with suspicion of, overlapping populations; (4) study purpose not in the field of interest, which was to estimate diagnostic performance of the AI-assisted MRI in classifying true progression from nonprogression, and (5) insufficient data for the reconstruction of 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables. \n\nLiterature search and selection were performed independently by two radiologists (H.Y.K. and S.J.C. with 6 and 7 years of experience in radiology, respectively). Any disagreement between the two reviewers was resolved via consultation of the third reviewer (L.S., with 10 years of experience in neuroradiology, and six years of experience in AI research). \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nData extraction was performed in a standardized form in adherence to the PRISMA guideline.  We extracted the following data: (1) characteristics of the included studies: authors, year of publication, institution, country of origin, study period, study design (prospective vs retrospective), whether radiomics was used, whether DL was used, patient population from which classification was made (limited to radiation necrosis vs. extended to other conditions of nonprogression including stable disease or regression), method of internal validation, whether external validation was performed, number of included patients, male to female ratio, number of included tumor, proportion of true progression, proportion of lung cancer as the primary site, reference standard, and inclusion and exclusion criteria; (2) characteristics of MRI: machine, field strength, in-plane resolution, slice thickness, dimension, MRI scan point (pre- or postradiotherapy), and sequence used for analysis; (3) characteristics of radiomics (as all studies in the final selection turned out to have used radiomics): segmentation slice (2D [region of interest in two dimension] vs. 3D [volume of interest in three dimension]), subregion segmentation, method of segmentation (manual vs semiautomatic), use of voxel size resampling, filter, normalization, and discretization; (4) characteristics of model development: feature selection method, classification method, number of extracted radiomics feature, and finally selected feature number. \n\n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nTwo reviewers (H.Y.K. and S.J.C.) independently assessed and achieved consensus for the methodological quality of the enrolled studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) criteria  and the six domains of the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) by Park et al.  The RQS originally suggested by Lambin et al.  consists of 16 components, with a maximal achievable score of 36. Park et al.  categorized the 16 components of the RQS into 6 domains, where a score of at least 1 point without minus points in each domain was regarded as adherence. The six domains are as shown in  . Detailed definitions of each component could be found in Lambin et al. \n\n\n### Data Synthesis and Analyses \n  \nThe primary endpoint of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to measure the diagnostic performance of AI-assisted MRI in classifying true progression from nonprogression. The secondary endpoint was to identify factors attributable to the heterogeneity in the included studies. \n\nWe measured the pooled sensitivity and specificity with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using bivariate random-effects modeling.  We presented the results graphically using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves with 95% confidence and prediction regions. Publication bias was analyzed using Deeks\u2019 funnel plot, with Deeks\u2019 asymmetry test being used to calculate the   P  -value and determine statistical significance.  Heterogeneity across the selected studies was evaluated using the Cochran Q test, where value   P  -value < .05 indicated the presence of heterogeneity.  According to the Higgins I  statistic, heterogeneity was classified as follows: 0\u201340%, might not be important; 30\u201360%, moderate heterogeneity; 50\u201390%, substantial heterogeneity; and 75\u2013100%, considerable heterogeneity.  The presence of a threshold effect (a positive correlation between sensitivity and false-positive rate) was sequentially evaluated: initially via visual assessment of the coupled forest plots of sensitivity and specificity; and secondarily via Kendall\u2019s Tau, with a   P  -value of less than 0.05 indicating the presence of the threshold. \n\nTo determine the factors attributable to heterogeneity across the studies, we performed meta-regression analyses using the following covariates: (1) study characteristics (total tumor number, the multiplicity of tumor per patient, the ratio of true progression to nonprogression, proportion of lung cancer, proportion of pathologically confirmed tumor, patient group), (2) MRI characteristics (MR field strength used, MR sequence used), and (3) radiomics characteristics (number of extracted radiomics feature, delta radiomics, segmentation method, segmentation slice, and voxel size resampling). One of the authors (S.J.C., with three years of experience in performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses) performed the statistical analyses using the MIDAS and METANDI modules in STATA 16.0 (StataCorp). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Literature Search \n  \nOur literature search identified 508 studies initially ( ). After removing 137 duplicates, the remaining 371 studies were screened mainly at the title and abstract level and the full-text level if necessary, yielding 13 potentially eligible studies. No additional study was identified after a manual review of those 13 studies\u2019 bibliographies. After a full-text review of the 13 eligible studies, six studies were excluded for the reasons as follows: five studies had insufficient information for the reconstruction of 2 \u00d7 2 table,  and one study had overlap in the study population with one of the finally included studies.  Finally, seven studies  were included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis. \n  \nFlow diagram of the study selection process. \n  \n\n### Characteristics of the Included Studies \n  \nAll studies used radiomics with retrospective design to classify true progression from nonprogression on AI-assisted MRI ( ). Except for two studies,  all studies delimited nonprogression to cases of radiation necrosis. Thus, all studies except for those two studies were of case-control design. All studies lacked external validation of their results. The number of patients across all studies was 485, with the number in individual studies ranging from 20 to 100 patients ( ). The number of tumors across all studies was 907, with the number in individual studies ranging from 20 to 408. Five studies  included multiple tumors per patient in the analysis. The proportion of tumors adjudicated to be true progression ranged from 7.8% (32/408) to 75% (73/97) across the studies. The proportion of lung cancer as the primary site ranged from 25% (21/84) to 75% (15/20). The reference standard for true progression and nonprogression was based on pathology and clinical follow up in five studies,  on pathology alone in one study,  and clinical follow up alone in one another study.  The details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria in each study were described in  . \n  \nCharacteristics of the Included Studies \n    \n\n### MRI, Radiomics, and Model Development in the Included Studies \n  \nInformation regarding MR field strength, in plane resolution, and slice thickness is detailed in  . Except for one study  that only used images acquired before radiotherapy, all studies used images acquired after radiotherapy. One study  used images acquired both before and after radiotherapy. Contrast-enhanced T1 weighted images were used for the analysis in all studies, while T2 FLAIR or T2 weighted images were analyzed additionally in five studies.  Many studies lacked detailed information regarding image segmentation for radiomics feature extraction. The region used for radiomics feature extraction in each study is summarized in  . Image segmentation was conducted semi-automatically in five studies  and manually in the remaining two studies.  There was variable use of the radiomics techniques; voxel size resampling was used in four studies,  filtering in four studies,  image normalization in four studies,  and discretization in four studies.  The categories of radiomics features used in each study are summarized in  . The number of extracted radiomics features ranged from 42 to 3072 across the studies, with more than 400 features used in three studies,  and less than 400 features used in the remaining four studies.  Finally selected feature numbers ranged from four to 12. Detailed feature selection methods and classification methods are summarized in  . \n  \nCharacteristics of MRI, Radiomics, and Model Development \n    \n\n### Diagnostic Performance of the MRI \n  \nAcross the seven studies, the pooled sensitivity was 77% (95% CI, 70\u201383%), and the pooled specificity was 74% (95% CI, 64\u201382%). The range of sensitivity and specificity across the seven studies was 60\u201392% and 58\u201387%, respectively ( ). The area under the HSROC curve was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.78\u20130.85) ( ). The difference between the 95% confidence and the prediction regions was relatively large, indicating heterogeneity among the studies. According to the Q test, heterogeneity was present (  P   = .026), mainly due to the heterogeneity in the specificity (  P   < .01) and not sensitivity (  P   = .09). Higgins I  statistics were also suggestive of heterogeneity that \u201cmight not be important\u201d in the sensitivity (I  = 44.5%) and moderate heterogeneity in the specificity (I  = 73%). There was no threshold effect (Kendall\u2019s Tau value of \u22120.04,   P   = .76). According to Deeks\u2019 funnel plot, the likelihood of publication bias was low, with a   P  -value of .54 for the slope coefficient ( ). \n  \nForest plots showing pooled sensitivity and specificity of AI-assisted MRI in classifying true progression from nonprogression after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain metastasis.

Those factors were the proportion of lung cancer as the primary site, proportion of pathologically confirmed tumor, MR field strength used, and segmentation slice. Sensitivity was increased while specificity was lowered, in the studies with 50% or higher proportion of lung cancer as the primary site, with less than 50% of the pathologically confirmed tumor, and in the studies that used MR field strength of 1.5T only, and VOI in segmentation. \n  \nMeta-Regression of MRI Radiomics for Classifying True Progression from Nonprogression \n    \n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nOverall ratings were favorable in terms of the QUADAS-2 criteria ( ). In the patient selection domain, 5 studies were considered to have an unclear risk of bias due to the case-control study design and unclear information regarding inappropriate exclusion.  In the flow and timing domain, 6 studies were considered to have an unclear risk of bias, since not all patients underwent the same reference standard procedure, but were adjudicated based on either pathology or clinical follow-up results. Otherwise, the bias risks in the index test and reference standard were regarded as low in all studies. There was low concern regarding applicability in the patient selection, index test, and the reference standard for all studies. \n  \nQuality assessment of the studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) and the radiomics quality score (RQS). In the flow and diming domain, six studies were considered to have an unclear risk of bias, since not all patients underwent the same reference standard procedure but were adjudicated based on either pathology or clinical follow-up results. \n  \nThe quality of the studies was further assessed using RQS. The scores were low (below 4) in all studies. All studies  showed adherence to the model performance index (domain 4). However, only three studies showed adherence to domain 1 (protocol quality and stability in image and segmentation),  and another three studies to domain 3 (biologic/clinical validation and utility).  Furthermore, none of the studies adhered to domain 2 (feature selection and validation), domain 5 (high level of evidence), and domain 6 (open science and data). The detailed score according to the domains was presented in  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis systematic review and meta-analysis included seven studies that aimed to classify true progression after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain metastasis on MRI with the aid of AI. Across the seven studies  including 485 patients and 907 tumors, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 77% (95% CI, 70\u201383%) and 74% (64\u201382%), respectively. Heterogeneity was present, mainly in the specificity but not sensitivity. Study quality was overall favorable in terms of the QUADAS-2 criteria, but not in terms of the RQS. \n\nAs a classification of true progression on standard MRI alone is difficult, other advanced imaging modalities such as MR perfusion, MRS, or PET have also been proposed.  Although the pooled sensitivities and specificities across the studies that investigated those advanced imaging modalities were generally above 80% according to a previous systematic review,  the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) working group considers those previous studies as inadequately robust to render any solid evidence and thus recommends multidisciplinary team decision rather than relying on any one of those imaging modalities.  In fact, the previous studies included small numbers of patients and lacked external validation. Moreover, due to difficulties in establishing a definitive diagnosis, many of the previous studies were conducted with a case-control design (ie, including only the patients who underwent pathological confirmation), rather than with a cohort including all patients presenting with the new or enlarging enhancing lesion. \n\nMeanwhile, AI has been increasingly utilized in medical imaging, such as for diagnosis and prediction of risk and prognosis. If diagnostic accuracy in classifying true progression after radiotherapy on standard imaging could be improved by using AI, it may usher in a breakthrough in the challenge. However, our study results suggest otherwise, with the performance of AI-assisted MRI not much superior to the reported performances of imaging modalities without the assistance of AI. The disappointing results may be attributable to the inadequate size of training data, inappropriate AI algorithm, or the intricate nature of the challenge that is unsolvable even by applying AI. Robustly designed future studies that address those issues are needed, preferably with a larger number of patients in the training set. Future studies that apply deep learning are also warranted; although our systematic search was targeted for any kind of AI, all retrieved studies had used radiomics. Another way of improving the diagnostic accuracy would be to take temporal changes of imaging findings into account, rather than using data from a single time point (eg, when a new or enlarging enhancing lesion was initially detected on MRI). Although two of our studies  had already incorporated such a concept by using delta radiomics and did not show significant improvement in the performance, further research using data from multiple time points (eg, pre-RT, two post-RT images) could be attempted. \n\nAlthough there was no significant threshold effect, substantial heterogeneity still existed, especially in specificity but not in sensitivity. Several covariates, including the proportion of lung cancer as the primary site, proportion of pathologically confirmed tumor, MR field strength, and segmentation slice, showed a statistically significant association with the heterogeneity. Lung cancer is the most common primary cancer of brain metastasis,  and thus studies with the proportion of lung cancer as the primary site of 50% or higher would better represent the real population compared to those with the proportion lower than 50%. Radiomics feature selection and subsequent analysis are known to be affected substantially by imaging acquisition parameters and reconstruction techniques.  Thus, the MR field strength and the segmentation slice used (ROI vs VOI) may have contributed to the heterogeneity in our results. Moreover, in case ROI was used, there is a possibility that the slice selected for feature extraction may not have represented the overall tumor nature appropriately, as the target lesion may be a mixture of both recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis. \n\nAlthough the quality assessment in terms of the QUADAS-2  was relatively favorable, that in terms of the RQS  was generally poor. Adherence was especially low in domain 2 (feature selection and validation), domain 5 (high level of evidence), and domain 6 (open science and data), mostly due to the lack of external validation, prospective study design, and open-source data. Low adherence in domain 6 calls for further efforts in inter-institutional data and model sharing, which is critical in generating reproducible study results. Adherence in domain 1 was also suboptimal in most studies, raising concern regarding the repeatability and reproducibility of the study procedure. Although expectations for AI to be a panacea for our diagnostic challenges are high, there are also concerns that complexity and \u201cblack box\u201d nature inherent to AI make it difficult for others to apply the algorithm to clinical workflow or to perform external validation.  Such lack of transparency calls for firm adherence to standardized methodological and reporting procedures. However, there are yet established guidelines for the reporting and quality assessment of the diagnostic accuracy or prognostic studies using AI, which is a relatively nascent methodology. The release of AI-specific extension to the STARD (Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) and TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis) is underway,  and future studies on classifying true progression after radiotherapy would hopefully be conducted according to those new guidelines. \n\nThere were limitations in our study. First, the numbers of studies in each subgroup in the meta-regression were mostly small, possibly inadequate for drawing statistically robust conclusions. Second, there were substantial differences in the methodology across the studies, raising concern in pooling the results. For example, unlike the rest of the studies that reported the diagnostic performance by using radiomics features alone, the study by Mouraviev et al.  had reported the performance of radiomics features in addition to clinical features. Karami et al.  and Zhang et al.  incorporated delta radiomics by using MR images from more than one time point, and Mouraviev et al.  used pre-RT MR images, whereas the remaining studies used only the MR images at a single time point after RT. Moreover, the inclusion of patients who had received whole-brain radiotherapy varied across the studies, with most studies lacking detailed information regarding the patients\u2019 previous treatment history. Nevertheless, we chose to use broad inclusion criteria, and instead analyzed various factors and clinical settings attributable to the heterogeneity affecting the diagnostic performance. Third, only two studies  reported the performance of neuro-radiologists on standard MRI without the aid of AI. Thus, it was not possible to measure the added value of the AI compared to the conventional MRI. Fourth, not all step-by-step procedures of radiomics were detailed in the included studies. Thus, substantial heterogeneity caused by varied methodologies across the studies may not have been captured adequately in this systematic review. Nevertheless, all included studies have shared the general pipeline of radiomics (ie, beginning from image acquisition, segmentation, preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, to validation of model performance). Methodological heterogeneity in studies using AI, including but not limited to those using radiomics, is almost inevitable. However, we may hopefully have a better understanding of the source of heterogeneity via the research community\u2019s more dedicated data and model sharing. \n\nIn conclusion, our systematic review of studies that used AI in classifying true progression after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain metastasis has identified seven studies, all of which had used radiomics but not deep learning. The diagnostic performance of AI-assisted MRI seems yet inadequate to be used reliably in clinical practice. Further studies with improved methodologies and a larger training set are needed. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8350153, "text_md5": "4e0be45c538619e3f33773457aa12b22", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 146], "journal": [147, 161], "publication_year": [163, 167], "title": [178, 327], "keywords": [341, 436], "abstract": [449, 2283], "body": [2292, 29029]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 34377988, "doi": "10.1093/noajnl/vdab080", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8350153", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8350153"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8350153\">8350153</a>", "list_title": "PMC8350153  Classification of true progression after radiotherapy of brain metastasis on MRI using artificial intelligence: a systematic review and meta-analysis"}

Collectively, epidemiological studies show that leisure activities with high mental and social demands are linked with better cognition in old age. The extent to which socio-intellectual activities relate to the brain\u2019s structure is, however, not yet fully understood. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes magnetic resonance imaging studies that have investigated whether cognitive and social activities correlate with measures of gray and white matter volume, white matter microstructure and white matter lesions. Across eighteen included studies (total n\u202f=\u202f8429), activity levels were associated with whole-brain white matter volume, white matter lesions and regional gray matter volume, although effect sizes were small. No associations were found for global gray matter volume and the evidence concerning white matter microstructure was inconclusive. While the causality of the reviewed associations needs to be established, our findings implicate socio-intellectual activity levels as promising targets for interventions aimed at promoting healthy brain aging. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe proportion of older adults is rapidly growing worldwide, with concurrent increases in the number of individuals living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease ( ). As a result, there is considerable interest among the scientific community to identify modifiable factors that promote healthy cognitive aging, with the overarching aim to develop interventions that slow, delay or prevent cognitive impairment in old age. These research efforts have been fruitful, with activities undertaken during an individual\u2019s leisure time emerging as one of several potentially protective factors ( ;  ;  ;  ). Benefits have been reported for both cognitive activities (CA), which predominantly require mental engagement with minimal interpersonal interactions, and social activities (SA), where the core feature is socializing with others ( ). For example, a meta-analysis conducted by   identified CA as significantly correlated with a lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia, higher levels of global cognition and better performance on tests of executive functioning, memory, processing speed and language. Infrequent participation in SA has also been related to more rapid mental decline ( ). While the link between leisure activities and old age cognition is well established, the neurobiological mechanisms supporting these associations are not yet fully understood. \n\nNeuroimaging techniques provide a powerful tool for examining the neural mechanisms underlying the link between leisure activities and old age cognition ( ). Neuroimaging studies published within this area broadly fall into three categories: (1) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (2) functional MRI (fMRI) and (3) Positron emission tomography (PET)/Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Structural MRI measures the neuroanatomical properties of the brain, including global and regional gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume, WM microstructure and WM lesions ( ). These structural features have been proposed as indices of   \u2018brain reserve\u2019   ( ,  ), where higher levels (e.g. greater GM and WM volume) correspond to a better tolerance of age- and disease-related damage ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ). In contrast, task-based and resting-state fMRI can investigate activation patterns and functional connectivity ( ). These approaches have been used to investigate mechanisms underlying   \u2018cognitive reserve\u2019,   referring to the brain\u2019s capacity to functionally adapt or compensate for age- or disease-related neural insult ( ;  ). Finally, PET and SPECT studies are sensitive to several different biomarkers of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathology, including beta amyloid deposition, hypometabolism and perfusion deficits ( ). Leisure activities are widely considered to have   neuroprotective   effects on the aging brain, either by (1) promoting   brain reserve  , (2) supporting   cognitive reserve   or (3) disrupting the progression of AD ( ;  ,  ). Given that the findings of PET and SPECT studies have been comprehensively summarized and discussed elsewhere ( ) and fMRI studies are few in number, this review will primarily focus on structural MRI studies to evaluate the hypothesized role of leisure activities in   brain reserve  . \n\nThe neuroanatomical changes that emerge with advanced age have been well characterized by structural MRI studies. Such studies indicate that aging is closely associated with brain atrophy ( ), with GM loss concentrated in the prefrontal cortices and concurrent shrinkage of sub-cortical structures, including the hippocampus ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Global and region-specific reductions in WM volume are also consistently reported ( ;  ;  ;  ) along with the development of periventricular and deep WM hyperintensities in 39\u201396% of the older adult population ( ). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have provided further insight into the age-related microstructural changes of WM ( ). Both global and region-specific WM integrity appears to deteriorate with age, as indicated by reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) and increases in mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD;  ;  ;  ;  ). Overall, aging is associated with widespread patterns of change in the brain, including GM and WM loss, the appearance of lesions and reduced microstructural quality in the WM, which each contribute to cognitive decline in later life ( ;  ;  ). \n\nA growing number of studies using MRI techniques have begun to explore the relationship between leisure activities and age-related brain structure (e.g.  ;  ;  ;  ), with mixed evidence regarding whether CA consistently relates to structural MRI markers of aging ( ). As we are not aware of any comprehensive systematic reviews or meta-analyses, we aim to address this gap in the present review. Specifically, our main objective is to systematically summarize the results of cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI studies that have investigated the relationship between levels of CA and SA in older populations. As age affects both GM and WM tissue ( ), we include structural and diffusion-weighted MRI markers in the review to gain insight into whether leisure activities relate to both macro- and micro-structural properties of the aging brain. Based on the rationale that leisure activities are neuroprotective ( ;  ;  ), we hypothesize that frequently participating in CA and SA will be associated with greater GM and WM volume, higher WM integrity and fewer WM lesions. \n\n\n## Method \n  \n### Data sources \n  \nStudies were searched for on the online databases EMBASE, MEDLINE and PSYCHINFO, using the interface MEDLINE Ovid in December 2017. The list of terms used in the formal search strategy was compiled after conducting a preliminary exploration of existing literature, where the keywords of articles deemed to be potentially relevant were extracted. An example of the keywords used for the MEDLINE search are shown in Supplementary material: Fig. S1. These terms were adapted for the two remaining databases. The reference lists of relevant studies were also screened to ensure that all literature appropriate to the review was captured and assessed for eligibility. \n\n\n### Inclusion criteria \n  \n  \nPublished as a research article. \n  \nEngagement in CA and/ or SA was directly assessed with a self-report questionnaire. To maximize the number of studies included in this review, those that had measured both types of activities and combined them for the analyses to produce an overall leisure activity engagement score were also included. \n  \nThe study included a single MRI session (cross-sectional design) or multiple MRI assessments (longitudinal design). \n  \nAn observational study design was used. This criterion was introduced to ensure that the included studies were relatively homogenous in design, allowing for the results to be sufficiently comparable. \n  \nAt least one of the following MRI measures was examined in the study: GM volume, WM volume, WM integrity (e.g. FA, MD) and the presence and severity of WM lesions. \n  \nThe relationship between activity levels and MRI outcomes or group differences in MRI outcomes (i.e. between groups with high/ low activity engagement) was directly examined. Mediation analyses (e.g. examining whether measures of GM volume mediated the association between activity engagement and cognitive function) were not included. \n  \nThe sample consisted of healthy older adults (i.e. without a diagnosis of dementia) with a mean age 60 years or over. \n  \nThe study was published in the English language. \n  \n\n\n### Study identification and selection \n  \nAuthors MA and ND independently screened the titles and abstracts of all of the citations identified by the search. These authors also reviewed the full text versions of a subset of citations to evaluate whether they met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nAuthors MA and ND separately carried out data extraction using identical structured forms, which were subsequently compared to ensure consistency and accuracy in the information collected. The study-specific information collected included sample characteristics (e.g. age, gender, percentage of females), study design (cross-sectional or longitudinal MRI, duration between measurements of activity engagement and MRI), MRI analyses (e.g. voxel-based morphometry/region-of-interest, WM lesion assessments), activity engagement (e.g. type of activity, life-time period of activity engagement, questionnaire administered), aspects of GM and WM measured (i.e. GM volume, WM volume, WM microstructure, WM lesions) and the findings reported (statistically significant results as indicated by   p   < 0.05, direction of association/group differences observed, co-variates controlled for). \n\nDue to substantial inter-study heterogeneity in the definitions of CA and SA used, we evaluated the set of activities that an individual study had measured against the classifications of CA and SA proposed by  , (Supplementary material: Table S1.) and re-categorized them accordingly. For the table of results, studies are divided into either cross-sectional or longitudinal MRI, where the former consists of a single MRI session and the latter integrates multiple MRI assessments. To improve comparability among the reviewed studies, age- and gender-adjusted analyses are reported in the tables of results, where possible. The results of these analyses following further co-variate adjustments (e.g. medical history, body mass index), can be found in the footnotes of each table. If, however, the outcome of age- and gender- controlled analyses had not been included in an article, we instead present their fully adjusted analyses in the tables. Finally, regions found to be significantly associated with activity engagement are grouped based on the major lobe or tract of the brain they are contained within (e.g. frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital and limbic). \n\nTo be included in the meta-analysis, studies drawn from the systematic review were required to meet the additional criteria of having performed region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. Voxel-based-morphometry (VBM) studies were excluded as these could introduce substantial bias and are more suitable for alternative methods (e.g. image- or coordinates-based;  ). A meta-analysis was not conducted for local WM volume as only VBM studies had assessed this outcome. Similar to previous publications ( ;  ), a meta-analysis was only carried out on a particular lobe, subcortical structure or tract if it had been examined by at least three studies. This threshold was not met by studies that had examined white matter microstructure (WMM) or GM volume within the different lobes, hence their results are only considered in the systematic review. Further, we could not directly examine the separate effects of CA and SA due to there being only a small number of studies published to date. The meta-analysis therefore examines the   combined   effects of CA and SA. Since   and   had overlapping samples, only the former was included in the analysis, as it contributed a larger number of participants. \n\nComprehensive Meta-Analysis (version 3.3,   November 20, 2014, Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ) was used to analyze the data. Sample sizes, p-values and the direction of associations were entered. The program calculated correlation coefficients based on the raw parameters provided, which were transformed into Fisher\u2019s Z before being converted back to correlation coefficients for reporting purposes. Fisher\u2019s r-to-z transformation was used as it provides a less biased summary index when the number of included studies is small ( ). Pooled effect sizes are presented as correlation coefficients to improve their interpretability ( ). To calculate these,   random effects models   were used to allow for inter-study variation and generalization to be made beyond the studies included ( ). Cochrane\u2019s Q was used to evaluate inter-study heterogeneity, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots (presented as Fisher's Z due to the unavailability of plots with correlation coefficients) and Begg and Mazumdar rank correlations test ( ). Authors were also contacted for further information on their analyses to ensure that as many studies as possible were included in this review. If exact p-values could not be obtained, we used the conservative estimate of 0.04 when a p-value within an article had been reported as <0.05 ( ). Conversely, a study that reported a non-significant finding as p\u202f>\u202f0.05 was estimated as p\u202f=\u202f0.5. Only when the direction of a reported association could not be determined, was the study excluded. As a minimum of ten studies are required to perform sub-group analyses and meta-regressions ( ), we were unable to assess the extent to which study design and sample characteristics moderated the examined effects. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nStudy quality was evaluated according to the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-sectional Studies ( ). This tool consists of fourteen questions, which assess several potential sources of bias in a study. Areas covered include assessment of measure validity, the suitability of the study design to address a given research question, the extent to which the sample is representative of the population of interest and whether key confounders are accounted for in the analyses. Two independent raters (authors MA and ND) rated each study as \u2018Good\u2019, \u2018Fair\u2019 or \u2018Poor\u2019. Any disagreements on the quality rating of a study were resolved through discussion. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe number of studies yielded at each stage of the search is displayed in Supplementary Material: Fig. S2. A total of eighteen studies were included in this review with the sample characteristics and details of the design of each included study displayed in  .   \nSample characteristicsand design of included studies. \n  Table 1       \n\n### Grey matter (GM) \n  \n#### Global GM volume \n  \nFive cross-sectional MRI studies have examined the relationship between current CA and SA engagement and global GM volume ( ). Three studies ( ;  ;  ) did not detect any associations between these variables. One study ( ) found that global GM volume positively correlated with SA levels, but found no association between changes in total GM volume and activity engagement at 5-year follow-up. In group comparisons, adults who most frequently participated in socially- and cognitively-demanding activities exhibited greater global GM volume when compared to those who were the least active in the cohort ( ).   \nCross-sectional MRI studies that have investigated the association between CA and SA engagement levels and global GM volume. \n  Table 2             \n\nA meta-analysis was conducted on four of these studies (pooled n\u202f=\u202f5718), which revealed that there was no association between late-life leisure activity levels and global GM volume (p\u202f=\u202f0.185,  ). Significant inter-study heterogeneity was, however, detected (Q\u202f=\u202f9.123, p\u202f=\u202f0.028, I  = 67.117). Visual inspection of a funnel plot (Supplementary material: Fig. S3) and a non-significant result from the Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test (\u03c4\u202f=\u202f0.167, two-tailed p\u202f=\u202f0.734) suggested that there was no substantial publication bias.   \nEffect sizes (correlation coefficient) for total GM volume: No significant association between CA and SA engagement and global GM volume. \n  Fig. 1   \n\n\n#### Local GM volume \n  \n presents the results of the twelve studies that have examined the relationship between non-physical activity participation and local GM volume. There were inter-study variations in the type of MRI analysis employed (i.e. VBM or ROI). Several of the reviewed ROIs studies reported associations between SA and CA engagement and GM volume that spanned all major lobes of the brain ( ;  ;  ). Among the cross-sectional VBM studies identified, late-life CA and SA participation have also been linked to GM volume in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes ( ;  ). In their voxel-wise analyses,   additionally found that more frequent current participation in SA correlated with greater temporal and parietal GM volume. One cross-sectional VBM study ( ), however, did not report any significant relationships between local GM volume and CA and SA participation during either mid-life or late-life.   \nCross-sectional and longitudinal MRI studies that have investigated the relationship between CA and SA participation and local GM volume. \n  Table 3             \n\nThe subcortical structure most commonly assessed was the hippocampus. While null findings have been reported ( ;  ;  ,  ), hippocampal volume has been found to correlate positively with regular late-life engagement in CA ( ), SA ( ;  ) or both types of activities ( ;  ) in a number of studies.   found that   mid-life, but not current  , activity levels were associated with GM in the hippocampus. Further,  ) reported that participants who regularly undertook leisure activities over their life-time exhibited less decline in hippocampal volume over three years (3.6%), compared to inactive individuals (8.3%). \n\nA meta-analysis was conducted using seven of the abovementioned ROI studies that had examined the hippocampus (pooled n\u202f=\u202f1455), to reveal a small, yet significant effect size of 0.097 (95% confidence interval\u202f=\u202f0.017 to 0.176, p\u202f=\u202f0.017,  ). Significant inter-study heterogeneity was also detected (Q\u202f=\u202f12.919, p\u202f=\u202f0.044, I  = 53.557). Publication bias appeared to be absent, as shown by a funnel plot (Supplementary material: Fig. S4) and a non-significant Begg & Mazumdar rank correlation test (\u03c4\u202f=\u202f0.286, two-tailed p\u202f=\u202f0.368).   \nEffect sizes (correlation coefficient) for hippocampal volume: Higher levels of CA and SA engagement are associated with greater hippocampal volume. \n  Fig. 2   \n\n\n\n### White matter (WM) \n  \n#### Global WM volume \n  \nSix studies have investigated the cross-sectional relationship between late-life participation in SA and CA and global assessments of WM volume. As shown in  , the results of four of these studies ( ;  ;  ;  ) were not significant, with one study also failing to find an association with mid-life CA or SA levels ( ). When controlling for age and gender,  ) reported that non-physical leisure activities in late adulthood were positively associated with normal appearing WM volume across the brain. However, this association was no longer significant after accounting for additional co-variates, including childhood IQ, occupation and medical history. The largest study published in this area to date (n\u202f=\u202f4304;  ), found that older adults who were most regularly engaged in social and intellectually stimulating activities had higher levels of total WM volume, compared to individuals who were the least engaged.   \nResults of cross-sectional MRI studies that have examined the association between CA and SA participation and global WM volume. \n  Table 4       \n\nA meta-analysis of four studies (pooled n\u202f=\u202f5736) revealed a significant and small effect size of 0.054 between current activity levels and global WM volume (95% confidence interval\u202f=\u202f0.028 to 0.080, p\u202f<\u202f0.001,  ). Tests for heterogeneity (Q\u202f=\u202f2.75, p\u202f=\u202f0.432, I  = 0.000) and publication bias, as assessed by a funnel plot (Supplementary material: Fig. S5) and the Begg & Mazumdar rank correlation test, were not significant (\u03c4\u202f=\u202f0.500, two-tailed p\u202f=\u202f0.308).   \nEffect sizes (correlation coefficient) for total WM volume: a positive relationship between CA and SA levels and whole-brain WM volume. \n  Fig. 3   \n\n\n#### Local WM volume \n  \nTwo studies examined regional measures of WM volume in relation to activity engagement ( ). While one of these studies reported null findings for mid-life and current activity levels ( ), the second study identified a positive cross-sectional relationship between current social activity participation and WM volume of the corpus callosum ( ).   \nFindings of cross-sectional MRI studies that have addressed the relationship between CA and SA engagement and region-specific measures of WM volume. \n  Table 5       \n\n\n#### Global WM lesions \n  \nIn total, seven studies have investigated the relationship between activity participation and whole-brain assessments of WM lesions ( ). One study found a positive cross-sectional correlation between life-time CA and SA engagement and global WM lesion volume, and further analyses indicated that mid-life and current activity levels were individually related to this outcome, although activity levels accumulated over a life-time was not ( ). Another study suggested that participants in the highest activity engagement quartile had lower volumes of WM hyperintensities (a difference of 12%), when compared to the least active quartile ( ). A further study did not detect any cross-sectional associations between activity engagement and WM lesions ( ). It did, however, find that declines in activity engagement over a three-year period were related to longitudinal increases in whole-brain WM lesions volume ( ). Four studies reported a lack of association between current or life-time levels of activity participation, WM lesion volume or severity rating ( ;  ;  ;  ).   \nFindings of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that have investigated whether CA and SA engagement is related to whole-brain WM lesions. \n  Table 6           \n\nA meta-analysis of five of these studies (pooled n\u202f=\u202f5587) detected a significant effect size of \u22120.048 (95% confidence interval = \u22120.090 to \u22120.006, p\u202f=\u202f0.026,  ). The test for heterogeneity was not significant (Q\u202f=\u202f5.020, p\u202f=\u202f0.285, I  = 20.314). Further, inspection of the funnel plot (Supplementary material: Fig. S6) and a non-significant Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test (\u03c4 = \u22120.100, two-tailed p\u202f=\u202f0.308p\u202f=\u202f0.806) suggested an absence of publication bias.   \nEffect sizes (correlation coefficient) for global WM lesions: Higher CA and SA levels are related to a reduction in whole-brain WM lesion volume. \n  Fig. 4   \n\n\n#### WMM \n  \nThree studies (2 cross-sectional, 1 longitudinal;  ) employed DTI to investigate associations between activity engagement and WMM. One study reported that higher levels of current CA and SA was related to greater FA in tracts including the left superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, fornix and corpus callosum ( ), and smaller AD and RD in a cluster localized to the thalamus. The second study ( ) found that increasing SA engagement over a three-year period was associated with greater FA and smaller MD in the corticospinal tract, with no significant associations to RD or AD in this region. Additionally, increasing participation in low complexity activities (e.g. television watching) was related to greater MD within this tract. Neither CA nor SA significantly correlated with DTI measures in any other of the WM tracts assessed, which consisted of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, forceps major and minor and cingulum cingulate gyrus ( ). The third study did not find a relationship between a composite measure of late-life SA and CA participation and global WMM ( ).   \nResults of cross-sectional and longitudinal DTI studies to have examined associations between CA and SA participation and WMM. \n  Table 7         \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Summary of findings \n  \nPrompted by epidemiological findings implicating a link between CA and SA levels and cognition in old age, an increasing number of MRI studies have investigated whether socio-intellectual activities directly relate to the structural integrity of the older adult\u2019s brain. We aimed to summarize the findings of these MRI studies in the present systematic review and meta-analysis. Through our literature search, we identified eighteen studies that met the eligibility criteria of this review. Overall, the reviewed evidence suggests that composite measures of CA and SA correlate with whole-brain volumetric assessments of WM volume and lesions, in addition to regional GM volume across the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital and limbic lobes, and the hippocampus. Despite the significant regional GM findings, there was no association found between activity levels and global GM volume. Furthermore, the results regarding WMM were inconclusive. Due to an insufficient number of studies published and mixed findings among existing studies, we are unable to make inferences concerning the independent associations of CA and SA with GM or WM outcomes. Importantly, for most of the associations identified in the reviewed literature, significant as well as null findings were reported. However, we regard the current evidence as promising and hold the view that future studies will help to further delineate the extent to which CA and SA levels relate to the aging brain. We next discuss the implications of the reviewed findings for the hypothesized role of leisure activities in brain aging, the potential neurobiological mechanisms mediating these effects, methodological considerations and avenues for further work. \n\n\n### Do socio-intellectual activities support neural mechanisms? \n  \nGM and WM indices are often considered proxies of   brain reserve   ( ,  ) among neuroimaging studies ( ). The associations found between leisure activities and GM and WM integrity may therefore suggest that   brain reserve   is a potential mechanism underlying the link between socio-intellectual activities and old age cognition. This is unlikely to be the only mechanism at play, as fMRI studies examining leisure activities also suggest a role of   cognitive reserve   in promoting cognitive function, in both healthy aging and AD ( ;  ;  ). For example, teaching a group of older individuals challenging and novel activities (i.e. digital photography and quilting) over a period of 14 weeks has been reported to improve the modulation of neural activity while performing semantic judgment tasks ( ). Being socially and intellectually engaged also appears to relate to reduced resting-state functional connectivity in the right inferior frontal cortex, interpreted as higher neural efficiency ( ). A comprehensive review by  ) further suggests that leisure activities may directly interact with the development of AD biomarkers (e.g. \u03b2-amyloid accumulation (A\u03b2), hypometabolism and brain atrophy) amongst healthy older adults. Indeed, higher lifetime engagement in cognitive activities has been related to lower levels of cortical A\u03b2 as measured by [(11)C] labeled Pittsburgh-Compound-B PET imaging ( ;  ). Taken together, there are at least three potential mechanisms underlying the associations found between leisure activities and old age cognition:   brain reserve, cognitive reserve   and slowing down the development of AD-related pathology. While our review suggests a role for   brain reserve  , it is yet to be determined whether these mechanisms are concurrently engaged, or whether one overtakes the other as an individual ages. Evidently, longitudinal imaging studies combining both structural and functional imaging techniques are needed to address this key outstanding question. \n\n\n### Neurobiological mechanisms \n  \nSeveral potential candidate processes may support the associations found between socio-intellectual activities and neuroimaging markers of   brain reserve   (overview provided in  ). For example, regularly engaging in socially- and intellectually- stimulating activities could increase the up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a molecule that stimulates neuronal growth and cell proliferation and is known to decline with age ( ). Sustained periods of activity might promote higher levels of BDNF, potentially contributing to neurogenesis or prolonging the survival of cells ( ). Indeed, greater neuronal density in the prefrontal cortex has been found in relation to more cognitively active lifestyles, at autopsy ( ). Synaptic or dendritic plasticity might also be enhanced, as indicated by increases in the number of synapses of neurons in the rat visual cortex following housing in a complex environment for a month ( ). Dendritic spines in the somatosensory cortex have also been shown to be sensitive to environmental enrichment in mice ( ).   \nSchematic diagram outlining the proposed neurobiological mechanisms that may support associations between activities and brain reserve and cognition, in old age. \n  Fig. 5   \n\nBDNF additionally appears to preserve the integrity of WM ( ) and promotes recovery following WM damage ( ). This is attributed to the regulatory role of BDNF in the regenerating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which are essential for the continued renewal of myelin in the central nervous system ( ;  ) with the production of OPCs typically attenuated with aging ( ). Interestingly, exposing adult rats to an enriched environment seems to lead to enhanced numbers of OPCs in the amygdala ( ) and corpus callosum ( ) relative to non-enriched rats. Although the evidence is limited, the forming of new blood vessels may explain the emerging protective role of CA and SA against WM lesions ( ), which develop as a consequence of long-term ischaemia and hypoxia ( ). Overall, there are a number of potential mechanisms that may support the reported links between activity and brain structure, including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, oligodendrogenesis and angiogenesis. \n\nThe following sections provide an overview of the current state of the reviewed evidence. We identified four methodological themes within the literature and these are each addressed in turn. \n\n\n### Methodological considerations: demographics and generalizability \n  \nThere was substantial heterogeneity within the pool of studies examined, including in their designs and sample characteristics. Nevertheless, all studies received a \u2018Good\u2019 rating suggesting that the quality of the evidence reviewed was highly consistent. We also generally found that participant demographics and recruitment methods were sufficiently described. Most of the included studies were based on secondary analyses of existing cohort data, where typically a subset of the baseline sample was used. Some studies used less than 10% of the original sample (e.g. 3.3%,  ; 8.94%,  ). A caveat of focusing on a such a small sub-group of participants is that it may inadvertently introduce a \u2018healthy volunteer\u2019 bias ( ), which was indeed observed for studies reporting the characteristics of included and excluded participants. Specifically, participants included in the analytical sample were generally younger, more cognitively intact (as indicated by MMSE scores) and less likely to be diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes ( ;  ). A portion of the reviewed studies also focused on select samples of older adults, such as male ex-employees of a lead manufacturing company ( ) or older women ( ). As a consequence, the results reported by these studies are unlikely to generalize to the wider older adult population. The present review was, however, unable to formally assess the existence of moderating variables using meta-regression due to the small number of studies included. Nevertheless, future reviews will be able to statistically evaluate whether factors, such as gender or MMSE score, moderate the reported associations as more data becomes available. This will help to clarify whether the review findings do indeed generalize to older adults as a whole, or are most relevant for specific sub-groups. \n\n\n### Methodological considerations: study design and directionality \n  \nCross-sectional MRI was the predominant design employed among the included studies, with only a small number integrating repeat MRI measurements ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The reviewed evidence was also correlational in nature, suggesting that the hypothesis of leisure activities impacting upon brain structure is not the only way to account for the present findings. For example, our results could be explained by progressive brain atrophy causing individuals to withdraw from hobbies, and/or those with larger brains being more inclined to participate in an intensive routine of activities. Alternatively, a common third variable (e.g. age) might underlie the associations reported. It should be noted that almost all of the included studies attempted to minimize this risk. For example, age and gender were typically controlled for in analyses, with further adjustments made for other co-variates (e.g. education, Apolipoprotein \u03b54 genotype). Nevertheless, the findings of well-designed RCTs need to be taken into consideration, so as to thoroughly evaluate whether a causal and independent relationship exists between leisure activities and late-life brain structure. \n\nA growing number of RCTs have begun to address the question of causality. Many of these studies indicate that GM enlargements and WM microstructural changes occur after a period of engagement in various mentally challenging tasks, including learning novel color names ( ), 3-ball juggling ( ;  ) and training in memory ( ) and reasoning domains ( ). More generally, cognitive training has reportedly lead to both structural and functional neural changes in older adults (reviewed in  ). Additionally, socializing at a community center over the course of 40 weeks appears to have increased total brain volume within a sample of elderly adults ( ). Overall, published RCTs provide further support towards the hypothesis that leisure activities directly affect brain structure. These studies are, however, not without their shortcomings. Many RCTs are currently limited by their short follow-up periods and small sample sizes, highlighting the need for large-scale longitudinal studies investigating the effects of leisure activities on the aging brain. \n\n\n### Methodological considerations: measurements of leisure activities and risk of bias \n  \nA key consideration for our review is the risk of measurement error attached to self-report questionnaires, which can be somewhat minimized if the measures used are validated. We generally found that assessments of leisure activities had acceptable psychometric properties. On the other hand, we also came across studies that had employed activity measures without evaluating their validity or reliability. These studies were, however, few in number. The most commonly employed questionnaire was the Cognitive Activities Scale (CAS;  ,  ,  ), which is widely validated and has been established in a research setting. This measure collects information on late-life activity levels, in addition to retrospectively asking respondents about activity engagement across the lifespan (e.g. childhood, early- and mid-adulthood). The CAS is clearly advantageous, as it can be used to probe how activity levels at different lifetime periods relate to various neuroimaging metrics of interest. On the other hand, it is also susceptible to misreporting, particularly among older adults with memory-related impairments ( ). This limitation may be avoidable if researchers prioritize cohort studies that have collected longitudinal data on activity levels and neuroimaging outcomes ( ). \n\nDespite efforts to ensure that the questionnaires used in research are psychometrically sound, they remain susceptible to reporting biases including social desirability ( ) and problems with memory recall ( ). Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of established objective measures of SA and CA that could easily overcome these problems inherent to self-report instruments. One potential solution may be to employ validated objective assessments used for other health behaviors (e.g. diet, physical activity), within this area of research. We suggest that wearable technology represents a feasible candidate that may be adopted by studies focusing on socio-intellectual activities in the near future. \n\nA wearable device often takes the form of a small portable camera worn around the neck or a badge worn on shirts, with the main function being to manually or automatically capture photos of the wearer\u2019s environment ( ;  ;  ). This type of technology has been used as an aid for individuals with memory impairments ( ), and more recently, as a research tool for the assessment of several modifiable behaviours, including diet and physical activity ( ). One example of a wearable device is the SenseCam, which has been shown to collect data more accurately (e.g. calorie intake) than detailed self-report assessments (e.g. food diaries;  ). Perhaps most importantly for the present review, this device can be used to differentiate between activities of varying social demands, such as those that are conducted alone or within a public space (with minimal interactions, such as within a shopping center) or that feature direct face-to-face interactions ( ). Overall, the described findings suggest that wearable technology may offer an objective way to measure socio-intellectual activities, which may be advantageous over currently used self-report methods. \n\n\n### Methodological considerations: defining and distinguishing between cognitive and social activities \n  \nThe final, but no less important, methodological theme concerns the definition and operationalization of CA and SA. Generally, CA and SA were not explicitly defined within the reviewed evidence, representing an issue observed more broadly across neuroimaging and epidemiological studies ( ;  ). There were, however, a few exceptions (e.g.  ). It might be argued that these constructs are self-explanatory and generally agreed upon, hence, no explicit definitions are required. Yet, this did not appear to be the case for the reviewed evidence, as indicated by considerable differences between studies in the number and type of individual activities used to define CA and SA constructs. Furthermore, activities that involved socializing (e.g. playing games) were sometimes classed as \u2018social\u2019 ( ;  ) and other times as \u2018cognitive\u2019 ( ,  ). To address these inter-study inconsistencies, we next outline potential criteria for CA and SA, which have been developed from existing definitions proposed in the broader literature. Authors of future studies could refer to these criteria when deciding on whether a given activity should be categorized as socially or cognitively demanding. \n\nBroadly speaking, previous definitions of CA have mainly emphasized a key role of information processing ( ;  ), or otherwise necessitated that an activity is mentally challenging or stimulating ( ;  ;  ). What constitutes mental challenge/ stimulation is, however, often left unspecified. The novelty of the information encountered could potentially be considered a defining feature of cognitive complexity (e.g. when learning a language;  ;  ). Yet, novelty alone is not sufficient. For example, a viewer may come across several new facts while watching the television, but only passively take this information in (Cheng, 2016). The   passive   nature of this activity may even partly account for why television watching is emerging as a potentially   harmful   activity for cognition (e.g.  ), relative to traditional \u2018cognitive\u2019 activities (e.g. reading;  ). This would suggest that   active   engagement with the information encountered is a crucial component for CA. In other words, it should involve the recruitment of one or several higher-level cognitive domains (e.g. executive function, memory;  ;  ). Cognitive training paradigms are indeed based on the premise that cognitive domains can be enhanced through intensive and repeated practice of them ( ). Overall, it appears that \u2018mentally challenging/ stimulating\u2019 activity (i.e. CA) should: (1) involve a degree of novelty (e.g. solving a new crossword puzzle, reading a book on an unfamiliar topic) and (2) necessitate one or more higher-level cognitive functions in order to successfully complete it. \n\nSA are typically defined as activities undertaken with others, with solitary activities on the other end of the spectrum (e.g.  ;  ). Although the presence of others is necessary to define SA, we argue that, this in itself, is not sufficient. Otherwise, activities intuitively recognized as   not socially demanding  , may be mis-categorized as such. For example, a lecture is usually given to a group of attendees, rather than a single individual. While being a group-orientated activity, \u2018attending a lecture\u2019 is almost exclusively defined as a \u2018cognitive\u2019 rather than \u2018social\u2019 activity ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ). This could be attributed to it missing a potentially crucial component of SA, i.e. the   direct   interactions between individuals. More generally, these direct interactions could take the form of engaging in a conversation, providing emotional support and shared reminiscing, among other examples. Based on our discussion, we put forward the following criteria for SA: the (1) presence of others and (2) explicit communication between members participating in the activity. \n\nThe second methodological issue is the operationalization of socio-intellectual activities. Specifically, the reviewed evidence mainly utilized two approaches. The first involves using the distinct categories of CA and SA, where each consists of an independent cluster of activities ( a). This method was employed by four of the included studies (see  ) and has the benefit of examining the individual effects of CA and SA. A major disadvantage is that it provides a poor fit for activities with both strong mental and interpersonal components (e.g. playing bridge;  ). Additionally, there was substantial disagreement among the reviewed studies on which particular activities fell under CA or SA. We sought to reduce these discrepancies by re-categorizing the reviewed studies in accordance with the distinctions of CA and SA suggested by  ). One alternative to distinguishing between CA and SA is to examine \u2018socio-intellectual activities\u2019 as a singular construct ( b), which was the method used by thirteen of the reviewed studies. This latter approach is advantageous over the former as it allows for activities to have concurrent social and cognitive demands, reduces inter-study disagreement and examines the combined effects of CA and SA. It is, however, not without its own set of problems. For example, it involves summing across a diverse range of activities, which has the risk of attenuating effects of interest and in extreme cases, producing null findings ( ). Relatedly, it prevents us from dis-entangling the potentially independent effects of socially and cognitively demanding activities on the aging brain. There are two additional methods that are currently underused by studies within this area, which may help to overcome the problems faced by the dichotomous and composite operationalizations of CA and SA. We suggest them as either substitutes or complimentary to currently employed approaches.   \nSchematic diagrams representing the different methods used to operationalize social (SA) and cognitive (CA) activities.   a.   SA and CA are treated as distinct constructs.   b.   SA and CA are combined into a single measure to reflect \u2018socio-intellectual activities\u2019.   c.   SA and CA are employed as distinct, but related constructs.   d.   Each activity item is examined as an independent correlate of the outcomes of interest. \n  Fig. 6   \n\nOne of the proposed methods is to operationalize CA and SA as two related, but distinct constructs ( c). In practice, this could involve rating each activity according to their perceived social and cognitive demands (e.g. low/ medium/ high), before combining activities with medium-to-high demands into CA and SA constructs. A similar approach was used in one of the reviewed studies ( ) and has also been used in studies examining cognition ( ). This method addresses the problem presented by activities with concurrent cognitive and social demands, as such items could feature in both the CA and SA constructs. It also shares a key advantage of the dichotomous method, in that it can be used to investigate the independent effects of CA and SA. As with all composite measures, however, it still retains the risk of attenuating effects of interests. To address this issue, we suggest that a complimentary approach is applied, if the statistical power of a study allows for it. Specifically, each activity within the CA and SA constructs could be evaluated as independent correlates of the neuroimaging outcomes examined ( d). Used by two of the included studies ( ;  ), this method may be particularly informative for intervention development. This is because it has the potential to highlight an activity (or set of activities) especially beneficial for brain health, and therefore identify potential targets for novel interventions. Overall, we propose that future studies should consider using the abovementioned approaches in their analyses, as they may aid the field in continuing to make sufficient progress towards developing interventions that promote healthy brain aging. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn the past decade, a growing number of MRI studies have started to focus on the relationship between CA and SA levels and the aging brain. Among the reviewed studies, we found that composite measures of CA and SA were related to global WM (volume and lesions) and hippocampal volume. Moreover, socio-intellectual activity levels correlated positively with regional GM volumes located within all major lobes of the brain. No link was found with global GM volume and studies examining WM microstructure produced inconsistent results. These findings are taken to suggest that leisure activities may contribute to   brain reserve  , with other neuroimaging studies also implicating a role in   cognitive reserve   and the development of AD-related neuropathology. As this field remains in its relative infancy, we propose several methodological improvements and avenues for further work. These suggestions have included (1) the use of multi-modal imaging and longitudinal RCTs, in addition to (2) wearable technology for the objective measurement of socio-intellectual activities. We also contribute (1) criteria for defining CA and SA and (2) suggest alternative methods to operationalize these constructs, which could be used by future studies. Overall, the current evidence supports a protective role of CA and SA against the negative effects of aging on GM and WM structures in the brain during late-life. \n\n\n## Conflicts of interest \n  \nThe authors declare no competing financial interests. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6562200, "text_md5": "7afd2c1a62388696c0379ea074f26183", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 62], "journal": [63, 84], "publication_year": [86, 90], "title": [101, 254], "keywords": [268, 410], "abstract": [423, 1923], "body": [1932, 48442]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 29940239, "doi": "10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.06.012", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6562200", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6562200"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6562200\">6562200</a>", "list_title": "PMC6562200  A systematic review and meta-analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating cognitive and social activity levels in older adults"}

This is largely attributed to the association with obesity and insulin resistance in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [ ,  ]. \n\nDetection and quantification of hepatic steatosis is clinically important. In NAFLD, steatosis is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and the earliest biomarker for the development of liver fibrosis in the more severe condition of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Early diagnosis and treatment of NASH can prevent the potential development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [ \u2013 ]. In hepatitis C, steatosis is associated with more severe fibrosis and rapid disease progression [ ,  ]. In liver transplantation surgery, the presence of steatosis impairs the regenerative capacity of the liver in both donor and recipient [ ,  ]. \n\nLiver biopsy remains the reference test for the evaluation of hepatic steatosis, despite well-established drawbacks regarding its invasiveness and sampling error due to small sample size and inter-observer variability [ ]. \n\nMany studies have focused on the role of imaging techniques as a non-invasive alternative to liver biopsy for detecting and quantifying hepatic steatosis [ \u2013 ]. The reported sensitivities and specificities between different imaging techniques and between different studies investigating the same technique vary substantially. Although magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( H-MRS)\u2014generally considered the best technique\u2014is increasingly used as a reference standard instead of liver biopsy, no evidence-based consensus currently exists on this topic. \n\nThe purpose of this systematic review therefore was to summarise the available literature on the accuracy of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and  H-MRS for the evaluation of hepatic steatosis with histopathology as the reference test. Subsequently, we aimed to identify the most accurate technique by meta-analysis. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Literature search and study selection \n  \nWe searched the MEDLINE (January 1966\u2013November 2009), EMBASE (January 1980\u2013November 2009), CINAHL and Cochrane databases without language restrictions with the assistance of an experienced clinical librarian. We combined Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and accompanying entry terms for the patient group (patients with hepatic steatosis) and the index test (US, CT, MRI,  H-MRS). The search strategy is described in detail in Online Resource 1. \n\nTwo reviewers (A.B. and J.v.W) read the titles and abstracts of all the articles obtained to select potentially relevant papers (original papers that addressed the diagnostic accuracy of US, CT, MRI or  H-MRS for detecting hepatic steatosis in humans with histopathology as the reference test in \u226510 individuals). The reference lists of selected papers and of narrative reviews were screened for search completion. \n\nThe full texts of potentially relevant papers were reviewed for inclusion by the same reviewers independently. Inclusion criteria were:   (a)   hepatic steatosis was evaluated with US, CT, MRI and/or  H-MRS;   (b)   imaging techniques met the minimum technical requirements of grey scale and real time for US; \u2264120\u00a0kV for CT and \u22651 Tesla for MRI;   (c)   histopathology as the reference test;   (d)   evaluation of \u226510 human individuals;   (e)   criteria for a positive index test were clearly explained;   (f)   examination method of steatosis on liver biopsy was clearly explained;   (g)   data on diagnostic accuracy were reported. Exclusion criteria were:   (a)   duplicate publication;   (b)   reporting of combined data for different imaging techniques or data on the single technique could not be extracted;   (c)   no original research. Papers were not blinded with regard to authors\u2019 names, affiliations or journal. The reviewers resolved all disagreements about inclusion and data extraction by consensus after face-to-face discussion. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nFrom the articles included, the reviewers (A.B. and J.v.W.) independently recorded data using a standardised form. Papers were translated if necessary. \n\n#### Methodological quality \n  \nMethodological quality was assessed based on the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy included in Systematic Reviews (QUADAS) guidelines [ ]. To be reasonably sure that the condition of the liver did not change between the two tests we chose a period of 1\u00a0month as a quality indicator [ ,  ]. Additionally, we noted whether the study design was prospective or retrospective. \n\n\n#### Patient characteristics \n  \nFor each study, we extracted data on   (a)   sample size;   (b)   male-female ratio;   (c)   patient age;   (d)   body mass index (BMI) and   (e)   patient spectrum. \n\n\n#### Imaging features and evaluation \n  \nFor each imaging technique we recorded   (a)   the number of patients;   (b)   the criteria used for steatosis evaluation and   (c)   the cut-off values used. We noted whether cut-off values were defined prospectively or retrospectively. Additionally, for US we noted the type and frequency of the probe(s) used. For CT we noted:   (a)   the type of CT and   (b)   the imaging parameters (kV and mAs). For MRI, we noted:   (a)   magnetic field strength;   (b)   imaging sequence;   (c)   imaging parameters used  ; (d)   whether breath holds were used; and   (e)   correction for T2* effects. For  H-MRS, we noted:   (a)   magnetic field strength;   (b)   imaging sequence;   (c)   imaging parameters;   (d)   voxel size;   (e)   whether breath holds were used and   (f)   correction for T1 or T2 effects. \n\n\n#### Reference test \n  \nFor liver biopsy we included data on:   (a)   the number of patients biopsied;   (b)   cut-off values for steatosis grades and whether the presence of   (c)   fibrosis   (d)   inflammation and   (e)   iron was evaluated in the biopsy specimen. \n\n\n#### Data for calculation of diagnostic accuracy \n  \nWe extracted available data on true-positives (TP), false-negatives (FN), false-positives (FP) and true-negatives (TN) for detecting steatosis with the selected imaging technique to construct 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 contingency tables. Available 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 and 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 tables were dichotomised. Many different cut-off values for positive results (steatosis present) on liver biopsy were compared to the imaging techniques. We therefore grouped accuracy results from cut-off values that were almost equal into four subgroups to enable meta-analysis:\n   \nCut-off values of >0%, >2% and >5% steatosis on biopsy; \n  \nCut-off values of >10%, >15% and >20% steatosis on biopsy; \n  \nCut-off values of >25%, >30% and >33% steatosis on biopsy and the qualitative designation of \u201cmoderate or severe\u201d steatosis; \n  \nCut-off values of >50%, >60% and >66% steatosis on biopsy and the qualitative designation of \u201csevere\u201d steatosis. \n  \n\nDuring analysis we corrected for dependent data such as results presented for different readers or for multiple imaging techniques within one study population. For CT and MRI, we did not use data obtained by subjective visual evaluation of examinations for analysis. If raw data in terms of 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 tables were unavailable, we attempted to contact authors for completion or verification of data. \n\n\n\n\n## Data analysis \n  \nWe performed bivariate random-effects analysis for the pooled sensitivities and specificities per cut-off value group for each imaging technique [ ]  .   In this analysis, the logit-transformed sensitivities and logit-transformed specificities from individual studies in a meta-analysis are assumed to follow a bivariate normal distribution around a mean logit sensitivity and a mean logit specificity. After antilogit transformation, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Additionally, we calculated the natural logarithm (ln) of the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR): [logit sensitivity + logit specificity]. The DOR is a single indicator of test performance [ ]. A higher lnDOR value indicates a better discriminatory test performance. If the lnDOR is not significantly different from 0, a test does not discriminate between patients with the disorder and those without it. We performed   z  -tests to compare sensitivities, specificities and lnDORs between imaging techniques. A   p   value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All meta-analyses were performed with SAS statistical software (version 9.1, SAS institute, Cary, NC, USA). \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Literature search and study selection \n  \nThe literature search yielded 6992 unique references (Fig.\u00a0 ). The reviewers selected 179 potentially relevant articles after reading the titles and abstracts of which 46 papers were finally included [ ,  \u2013 ]. Twenty-eight evaluated US, twelve evaluated CT, ten evaluated MRI and five evaluated  H-MRS. Eight papers compared two imaging techniques [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ] and one evaluated three techniques within the same population [ ] (Table\u00a0 ). Two studies were published in German [ ,  ] and the remaining in English.\n   \nFlow diagram of the articles included \n    \nPatient and design characteristics of 46 papers included \n  \n Epub   Published online ahead of print,   ND   Not defined,   BMI   Body Mass Index,   PSC   Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis,   ALD   Alcoholic Liver Disease,   CPH   Chronic Persistent Hepatitis,   PBC   Primary Biliary Cirrhosis,   HBV   Hepatitis B Virus,   HCV   Hepatitis C Virus,   NASH   Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis,   HIV   Human Immunodeficiency Virus,   NAFLD   Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,   AIH   Auto-immune Hepatitis \n\nP = prospective study design; R = retrospective study design \n\nUnless noted otherwise, data are mean \u00b1 standard deviation, with the range in parentheses \n\nMedian \n\nStandard error \n\n24 healthy individuals were matched with 24 patients for age and sex; Data for mean age \u00b1 SD are based on patient group (  n  \u2009=\u200924) \n  \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \n#### Methodological quality \n  \nAn overview of the results is given in Fig.\u00a0 . In general, 13 out of 46 (28%) studies fulfilled at least 10 of the 13 methodological criteria [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. A complete table of individual study scores is available upon request from the authors.\n   \nStudy design characteristics of the 46 studies included \n  \n\n\n#### Patient characteristics \n  \nThe 46 papers comprised 4715 patients with a median study size of 81 patients (range 20\u2013589). Mean age reported by 37 studies was 44.5\u00a0years (range 11\u201389). Mean BMI reported by 18 studies was 26.6\u00a0kg/m  (range 15\u201354\u00a0kg/m ). The male-to-female ratio reported in 40 studies was 1.62:1. Potential living liver donors constituted 34% of the total population (1593/4715). If specified, the disease spectrum comprised most frequently chronic hepatitis C (  n\u2009=  \u20091040) and NAFLD/NASH (  n\u2009=  \u2009710). See also Table\u00a0 . \n\n\n#### Imaging features and evaluation \n  \nUS imaging features are outlined in Online Resource 2. More than half (15/28) of the studies used the widely accepted criteria for subjective visual steatosis evaluation of bright liver with increased liver-kidney contrast; blurring of intrahepatic vessels and diaphragm and loss of echoes of posterior hepatic segments [ ,  ]. Two studies evaluated quantitative methods to assess liver steatosis [ ,  ]. \n\nCT imaging features are shown in Online Resource 3. Two papers evaluated both contrast-enhanced CT and unenhanced CT [ ,  ]. All other papers evaluated unenhanced CT. Average Hounsfield Units (HU) in selected regions of interests (ROIs) from the liver were compared with average HU values of ROIs from the spleen. The spleen was used as an internal reference in all the papers included, either by measuring the liver-minus-spleen attenuation value (L-S) or the liver-to-spleen ratio (L/S). Two studies also evaluated steatosis by subtracting hepatic blood attenuation from the total hepatic attenuation using an algorithm. Four papers had defined cut-off values prospectively [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Six papers defined optimal cut-off values retrospectively [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. The chosen cut-off values, however, varied substantially. \n\nMRI characteristics are outlined in Online Resource 4. Magnetic field strength for all included papers was 1.5 Tesla. Sequences used were T1-weighted dual spin echo, T1-weighted dual gradient echo or T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo for in-phase and out-of-phase (IP/OP) chemical shift imaging. Two studies also evaluated T2-weighted fast spin echo imaging with and without fat suppression (\u00b1FS). Liver steatosis was evaluated by the amount of signal intensity (SI) loss on OP images compared with IP images and by SI difference between FS and non-FS images. Exact measuring methods, however, differed. Correction for T2* effects was performed by d\u2019Assignies et al [ ]. Cho et al were the only authors to define cut-off values prospectively [ ]. \n\nH-MRS imaging characteristics are outlined in Online Resource 5. Magnetic field strengths were 1.5 T(3/5) and 3 T (2/5). Four papers used a point-resolved spectroscopic sequence (PRESS), one in combination with chemical-shift selective water suppression (CHESS). Kr\u0161\u0161\u00e1k et al used a stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) sequence [ ]. Voxel sizes varied from 18\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u2009\u00d7\u200918\u00a0mm to 30\u2009\u00d7\u200930\u2009\u00d7\u200940\u00a0mm. Hepatic steatosis was evaluated by the ratio of lipid versus water peaks and by the choline-to-lipid ratio. One paper each corrected for T2 effects or T1 and T2 effects [ ,  ]. All included studies defined cut-off values retrospectively. \n\n\n#### Reference test \n  \nDetails of the reference test are outlined in Online Resource 6. Cut-off values for grading steatosis severity differed among the articles included, complicating their comparison. Two studies compared semi-quantitative visual analysis of steatosis with the automatic vacuole segmentation method [ ] or gas-liquid chromatography [ ]. Thirty studies examined the presence of fibrosis, 24 examined the presence of inflammatory activity and eight studies examined the presence of iron. \n\n\n#### Data for calculation of diagnostic accuracy \n  \nExtraction of 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 accuracy data resulted in 48 complete data sets for US; 33 for CT; 15 for MRI and 7 for  H-MRS. For both CT and MRI, 5 datasets were not included for analysis because the examinations were visually assessed. This resulted in 28 datasets being analysed for CT and 10 datasets being analysed for MRI. Datasets with TP and FN only were also included for analysis: 4 for US and 1 for CT. The number of datasets per cut-off group is noted in Table\u00a0 . Six authors were contacted for completion or verification of data; three answered of which one supplied additional datasets. Three studies reported data-sets for multiple readers [ ,  ,  ].\n   \nSummary estimates of US, CT, MRI and  H-MRS per combined cut-off value group \n  \nLn DOR = logit sensitivity + logit specificity. NS = not significant \n\nNumber of datasets analysed \n\nFor CT and MRI: Only data for >0% and >5% available \n\nFor US and  H-MRS: Only data for >10% steatosis available \n\nCT includes data for >25% and >30% steatosis only; MRI includes data for >30% only;  H-MRS includes data for >30% and >33% only \n  \n\n\n\n\n## Data-analysis \n  \nSensitivity and specificity values including 95% confidence intervals (CI) and significant differences (  p  \u2009<\u20090.05) for the imaging techniques are presented in Table\u00a0  and in more detail in the Online Resources 7\u201310. \n\n### Group 1 (cut-off values of >0%, >2% and >5% steatosis) \n  \nSensitivity and specificity estimates were 73.3% and 84.4% for US; 46.1% and 93.5% for CT; 82.0% and 89.9% for MRI and 88.5% and 92.0% for  H-MRS, respectively. The sensitivity of  H-MRS was significantly higher than that of US (  p  \u2009=\u20090.04) and CT (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01) and the sensitivity of MRI was significantly higher than that of CT (  p  \u2009=\u20090.02). No significant differences in specificity were found. The lnDOR of  H-MRS was significantly higher compared with US (  p  \u2009=\u20090.02) and CT (  p  \u2009=\u20090.04). \n\n\n### Group 2 (cut-off values of >10%, >15% and >20% steatosis) \n  \nSensitivity and specificity estimates were 90.5% and 69.6% for US; 57.0% and 88.1% for CT; 90.0% and 95.3% for MRI and 82.6% and 94.3% for  H-MRS, respectively. CT had a significantly lower sensitivity compared with US, MRI and  H-MRS (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01,   p  \u2009<\u20090.01 and   p  \u2009=\u20090.02 respectively). Although US had a sensitivity comparable to MRI and  H-MRS, the specificity was significantly lower than CT (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01), MRI (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01) and  H-MRS (  p  \u2009=\u20090.01). The lnDOR of MRI was significantly higher than the lnDOR for both US (  p  \u2009=\u20090.05) and CT (  p  \u2009<\u20090.01).  H-MRS had a significantly higher lnDOR than CT (  p  \u2009=\u20090.03). \n\n\n### Group 3 (cut-off values of >25%, >30% and >33% steatosis) \n  \nSensitivity and specificity estimates were 85.7% and 85.2% for US; 72.0% and 94.6% for CT; 97.4% and 76.1% for MRI and 72.7% and 95.7% for  H-MRS, respectively. The sensitivity of MRI was significantly higher than CT (  p  \u2009=\u20090.01) and  H-MRS (  p  \u2009=\u20090.03). The specificity of MRI however was significantly lower than both CT (  p  \u2009=\u20090.02) and  H-MRS (  p  \u2009=\u20090.04). Further, the sensitivity for US was significantly higher than for CT (  p  \u2009=\u20090.03), the specificity for US was significantly lower than for CT (  p  \u2009=\u20090.03). Analysis of the lnDOR did not show any significant differences. \n\n\n### Group 4 (cut-off values of >50%, >60% and >66% steatosis) \n  \nFor this group, data analysis was possible for US only. Sensitivity and specificity estimates were 91.1% and 91.9% respectively. \n\nFigure\u00a0  shows the diagnostic performances (lnDOR) of all imaging techniques per cut-off value group, illustrating the better performance for both MRI and  H-MRS compared with US and CT.\n   \nComparison of logarithmic diagnostic odds ratios of US, CT, MRI and  H-MRS \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur results show that MRI and  H-MRS perform better than US and CT over the total range of cut-off values that were analysed. For the lower cut-off ranges, we found significant differences in favour of both MRI and  H-MRS. \n\nThese findings suggest that MRI and  H-MRS also perform better than US and CT for detecting separate disease grades, especially for mild disease (<30% steatosis). This is of value in clinical practice when an accurate estimation of the amount of hepatic steatosis is needed. Additional benefits of MRI and  H-MRS over US are the quantitative measurements which are less subject to inter- and intraobserver variability [ ]. For CT, drawbacks are the radiation exposure and factors affecting the accuracy of the results, such as imaging parameters or iron accumulation [ ,  ]. \n\nSeveral limitations of our study must be considered. First, the studies included showed great heterogeneity regarding patient spectrum, reference test, index test and data reporting. Therefore, comparison of separate disease grades and sub-analysis of different aetiologies of steatosis (e.g. NALFD/NASH versus HCV) was precluded. Standardisation of future study designs is needed to enable these comparisons. Moreover, no studies compared all four imaging techniques within the same population, which would be the ideal study design. We were therefore restricted to summarising accuracy data for each technique separately across all the studies included. These indirect comparisons of studies, which showed substantial methodological heterogeneity, might have biased our results. \n\nSecond, we had to make the decision to group accuracy results from different cut-off values into four subgroups to enable meta-analysis and to reduce the number of summary estimates and comparisons. The ideal situation would have been to analyse accuracy results for each cut-off value separately. \n\nThird, a standard method for meta-analysis of diagnostic studies is the summary Receiver Operating Characteristic (sROC). For the sROC approach, a negative correlation between the logit sensitivity and the logit specificity is required [ ]. As we did not find this negative correlation in our data, plotting of sROC curves was not possible. We therefore used the lnDOR to summarise our results. \n\nFourth, we did not analyse 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 or 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 data as the reporting thereof was scarce. By dichotomising the results, we lost information on the capability of imaging techniques to diagnose the degree of steatosis. \n\nA fifth limitation was that we chose to exclude articles with  H-MRS as the reference standard [ \u2013 ].  H-MRS is increasingly used as a reference standard for steatosis quantification since the results from the Dallas Heart Study were published by Szczepaniak et al in 2005 [ ]. However, no clear consensus on this topic currently exists. The articles that were excluded all compared MRI with  H-MRS and showed good correlations. Therefore, only a small number of datasets were available for analysis of MRI. Additionally, the included articles for MRI did not evaluate triple-echo, multi-echo or multi-interference techniques, whereas the aforementioned excluded articles did. Guiu et al recently suggested that these new techniques should replace the classical dual-echo chemical shift imaging methods, which are not reliable for quantification of liver fat in the case of liver iron overload because of T2* effects [ ]. We believe that the small number of available data in combination with the techniques used could have negatively influenced our accuracy results for MRI. \n\nWe therefore recommend that consensus on the role of  H-MRS as the reference standard needs to be established. For liver biopsy evaluation, we recommend using the classification from Kleiner et al for a uniform grading of hepatic steatosis [ ]. \n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that MRI and  H-MRS are most accurate for the detection of hepatic steatosis. For future research, it is important to improve the study design and reporting of accuracy results. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 2995875, "text_md5": "8d848bf6261b78040e8135d2d2dace83", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 80], "journal": [81, 91], "publication_year": [93, 97], "title": [108, 241], "keywords": [255, 388], "abstract": [401, 1925], "body": [1934, 23978]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 20680289, "doi": "10.1007/s00330-010-1905-5", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995875", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2995875"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995875\">2995875</a>", "list_title": "PMC2995875  The diagnostic accuracy of US, CT, MRI and 1H-MRS for the evaluation of hepatic steatosis compared with liver biopsy: a meta-analysis"}

Particular inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select the eligible studies. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy tool was used to assess the risk of bias and methodological quality of the eligible studies. From the included studies, the rate ratio (RR) of pooled accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and their corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for both PWI and PET. \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nThe systematic review and meta-analysis comprised 14 research studies, with a total of 542 patients. Although PET revealed a moderately higher accuracy and sensitivity when compared to PWI (RR: 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.02 and RR: 0.95 95% CI 0.85-1.06, respectively), the difference was not statistically significant (  p  >0.05). Similarly, while PWI demonstrated a moderately higher specificity when compared to PET (RR:1.10, 95% CI 0.98-1.23) but. However, no statistically significant difference between the 2 modalities was detected (  p  >0.05). Interestingly, we revealed that 18F-FET-PET was significantly more efficient than PWI in terms of accuracy (RR: 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.93) and sensitivity (RR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.62-0.83) (  p  >0.05). \n\n\n## Conclusion: \n  \nBoth PET and PWI yielded good diagnostic performance in distinguishing treatment-related changes from tumor recurrence, and neither modality seemed to be superior. PROSPERO ID: CRD42021288160 \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n B  rain tumors occur when abnormal and uncontrolled cell division appears in the brain. Nowadays, non-cancerous (benign) tumors and cancerous (malignant) tumors are the 2 groups of tumors recognized worldwide.  Brain tumors can also be categorized as primary tumors, starting in the brain, and secondary tumors, also known as brain metastasis tumors, which most frequently have spread to the brain from primary tumors in other organs.  The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States reported that primary brain tumors account for around 2% of all cancers, while metastases occur approximately in 10-20% of people with cancerous tumors and are 10 times more frequent than primary brain tumors.  The annual frequency of primary brain tumors can reach 19 cases per 100,000 people. The incidence is 3 cases per 100,000 people at less than 4 years of age. The prevalence decreases between 15 and 24 years of age and then increases regularly to a peak of 19 cases per 100,000 people between 65 and 79 years of age. \n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) classifies brain tumors into different types, and each of them may be classified into diverse grades, including neuroepithelial and non-neuroepithelial tumors.  The majority of primary tumors of the brain in adulthood are gliomas, with a prevalence of 45% among all brain tumors and 90% of primary brain tumors in elderly patients.  Gliomas are classified into 4 grades (I, II, III, and IV) based on the WHO classification. Low-grade gliomas include grades I and II, while high-grade gliomas include grades III and IV. The grade IV glioma is also known as glioblastoma multiforme. \n\nMany studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence of brain cancer in developed countries. Furthermore, the prevalence of brain cancer depends on many factors, such as age, gender, and race. Meningioma and glioblastoma are mostly detected at approximately 65 years of age. However, the other types of brain tumors, such as pilocytic astrocytoma, germ cell, and pineal region tumors are detected at an early age.  The prevalence of brain tumors is moderately greater in men as compared to that in women, but meningeal tumors seem to be 2 times as frequent among women. Regarding gliomas, their incidence is higher in men (7.7/100,000) as compared to that in women (5.61/100,000).  The prevalence of primary brain tumors is higher in Asian, white, and black populations with regard to American and Indian Native race groups. Brain cancers have a 5-year survival rate of approximately 33%. In general, high performance status, young age, and low histopathological grade are positive prognostic characteristics for primary brain tumors. \n\nTherapeutic options are dependent upon the kind of brain tumor, as well as its location and size. Treatments for brain tumors include surgical resection of solitary lesions, stereotactic brain surgery and radiation with or without chemotherapy.  Treatment-induced necrosis is a frequent treatment-related condition occurring during the treatment of gliomas, which is usually detected 3 to 12 months post-treatment.  Indeed, after high radiation doses, patients usually develop constant or continuous enhancement detected with recurrent tumors (pseudoprogression), radionecrosis and inflammation. These conditions mimic tumor progression or recurrence after remission.  Pseudoprogression appears as an increase in the size of the primary tumor or the appearance of a new lesion, thus resembling early progressive tumors.  It is evident that misdiagnosis of recurrent brain tumors changes the treatment strategy, which leads potentially to unnecessary repeat surgery or non-effective second-line treatment.  Histopathologic technique is the current gold standard to confirm the diagnosis of recurrent brain tumors, but biopsy is dangerous, with many adverse impacts (such as inflammation and hemorrhage).  Hence, differentiating tumor recurrence from other types of treatment-related changes is challenging. Consequently, valid, effective and non-invasive imaging techniques are required to improve the post-treatment surveillance of patients. \n\nDue to the disadvantages of histopathology, diverse neuroimaging techniques have been developed for the distinction of recurrent tumors from treatment-related changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and nuclear modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET), which can be associated with computed tomography (PET-CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI), are usually used for this purpose. \n\nNowadays, MRI is the standard neuroimaging modality for follow-up after treatment.  Standard MRI is based on the magnetization properties of atomic nuclei. The most common MRI sequences are T1-weighted and T2-weighted scans.  Even with the perfect ability to diagnosis brain tumors, the conventional MRI presents some limitations regarding the distinction between tumor recurrence and non-specific changes, which is especially relevant after therapy. \n\nTo surmount these deficiencies, PET based on radioactive amino acids and PWI are suggested as alternative modalities that may supply supplementary pathophysiological evidence to standard MRI. Perfusion-weighted imaging is one of the most broadly used clinical techniques. It is accurate, reliable, and safe, as well as radiation-free. There are 3 types of PWI-dynamic magnetic contrast-enhanced, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and arterial spin labeling.  In recent years, PET using radioactive amino acids has been considered a very pertinent modality and is described as clinically helpful for managing patients with brain tumors.  Different types of radioactively labeled tracers (such as, 11C-MET,  F-FDG [fluorine18-fluorodeoxyglucose],  F-FLT [fluorothymidine], or  F-FET [fluorine-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine]) are injected with PET to improve the detection of recurrent brain tumors.  The first radiopharmaceutical tracer to be developed was  C-methyl-L-methionine (MET), and  F-FDG is the most broadly applied tracer.  Nowadays, both of them are considered the best tracers for PET imaging of brain tumors.  In summary, imaging findings from PWI and PET may contribute, in addition to MRI, to improve both diagnostic and therapeutic planning, particularly in clinically challenging situations. However, each of these modalities has its disadvantages. Standard MRI does not produce reliable data to distinguish radiation-related changes from true tumor progression, while Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and PET can provide false positive results regarding recurrent tumors.  Despite their significant contribution to better differentiate recurrent tumors from treatment-related conditions, research comparing the effectiveness of PET and PWI is limited. \n\nTherefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate the diagnostic performance of PWI compared to PET for distinction between tumor recurrence and treatment-related changes. Then, we performed a subgroup analysis to investigate the effectiveness of each PET modality and tracer in comparison with PWI. \n\n## Methods \n  \nThis study was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.  The writing followed the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology scheme.  The Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, the Cochrane library, and CINAHL databases were used to search potentially interesting articles published from database inception until August 2021. A systematic search was performed by 2 independent reviewers, using the following terms \u201cperfusion MRI\u201d or \u201cperfusion magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cperfusion-weighted imaging\u201d or \u201cPWI\u201d and \u201cpositron emission tomography\u201d or \u201cPET\u201d and \u201cglioma\u201d or \u201cglioblastoma\u201d or \u201cbrain tumor\u201d and \u201crecurrent\u201d or \u201crecurrence.\u201d \n\nRelevant articles were screened by title and abstract after suppression of duplicates. Articles were included if they described the use of PWI and PET to detect brain tumor recurrence. Then, they were read in full text to verify eligibility. \n\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: i) patients with suspected radiological recurrence at the site of previously irradiated brain tumor; ii) histopathology or clinicoradiological diagnosis used as a reference to differentiate treatment-related effects from recurrent tumors; iii) use of PWI and PET; iv) publications reporting sufficient information on the sensitivity and specificity of each test; and v) studies published as original articles. The exclusion criteria were as follows: i) no full text electronically available; ii) publication in a language other than English; iii) comments, letters, editorials, protocols, guidelines, and review papers; iv) use of other imaging techniques (DWI or conventional MRI); or v) studies with insufficient outcome data. \n\nTwo independent reviewers independently retrieved information from the eligible articles following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the information was collected on a standardized data sheet that included author name, year, type of study, country, number and age of participants, diagnosis of tumor, time since radiation completed (days), modality and optimal cutoff, type of PET, the follow-up period and the reference technique used to differentiate pseudoprogression from recurrent tumors. The methodologic quality of the included studies was evaluated independently by 2 authors using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool, which includes four criteria\u2014\u201dpatient selection,\u201d \u201cindex test,\u201d \u201creference standard,\u201d and \u201cflow and timing\u201d.  The outcomes of interest were the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of PET and PWI to detect tumor recurrence. \n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity measures of the best effective parameter were pooled from each article. The statistical analyses were carried out using RevMan Version 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, United Kingdom). Rate ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adopted to compare the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy between PWI and PET. A   p   value of <0.05 was considered as the level of significance. The Cochrane Chi-squared test was conducted to assess heterogeneity among studies, with   p  <0.05 indicating the existence of heterogeneity. The I  value was used to estimate the impact of heterogeneity on the meta-analysis; I \u226550% and   p  <0.05 indicated a moderate to high degree of heterogeneity among pooled studies. When I <50% and   p  >0.05, a fixed effects model was conducted; if not, a random effects design was adopted.  Additionally, we carried out subgroup and sensitivity analyses to evaluate the likely cause of heterogeneity. Egger\u2019s test was carried out via Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25 (IBMCorp, Armonk, NY, USA) to evaluate publication bias. This latter was further assessed based on the visual inspection of the symmetry in funnel plots. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nDatabase searches identified 3315 articles to be screened, of which 1859 studies were revealed as potentially eligible and retrieved for full text review. Eligibility criteria were met by 14 studies, which were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The PRISMA study flowchart is shown in  . \n  \n- An outline of the PRISMA guidelines used to conduct this meta-analysis. \n  \nThe 14 included studies were published between 2008 and 2021 and distributed among 10 countries.  Among the 14 articles included in this meta-analysis, 3 were prospective studies and 11 were retrospective studies. The sample size of the included articles varied from 10 to 104 patients and the age varied between 8 and 81 years. Histopathology was the reference standard to detect tumor recurrence. The following 4 types of amino acid tracers were used with PET:  F-FDG (7 articles),  C-methionine (5 articles),  F-FET (2 articles), and fluorodopa (one article). The features of the studies are recapitulated in  . \n  \n- Features of included articles (N=14). \n  \nND: not defined, USA: United States of America \n    \n- Features of included articles (N=14) (continuation). \n  \nND - not defined, PET - positron emission tomography, MRI - magnetic resonance imaging, CT - computed tomography, PWI - perfusion-weighted imaging,  F-FDG -  fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose,  F-FET -  F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine,  F-FLT- (18)Fluorothymidine, CBV - Cerebral Blood Volume, TBR - Tumor to Background Ratio SUV - Standardized Uptake Value, F-DOPA - fluorodopa \n  \nRegarding patient selection, enrollment was cited in all articles. Considering the index test criteria, a specified threshold was mentioned in the majority of the articles. In addition, a low risk of bias was revealed in many articles in terms of flow and timing criteria (75%). Moreover, all studies had a low risk in terms of reference standard, since the diagnosis was based on histopathology. A recapitulation of the risk of bias is presented in  . \n  \n- Risk of bias items presented as percentages across all articles. PET: positron emission tomography, PWI: perfusion-weighted imaging, CI: confidence interval \n  \nOf the 14 included studies, 10 studies reported the accuracy of PWI and PET. The heterogeneity (\u03c7 =17.65,   p  =0.04, I =49%) was high, so a random effects model was adopted. The forest plot showed that the accuracy outcome was not significantly different between PWI and PET (RR=0.94, 95% CI: 0.86-1.02;   p  =0.15) ( ). \n  \n- Forest plot of the rate ratio of accuracy between perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and positron emission tomography (PET). CI: confidence interval \n  \nAll the studies reported the sensitivities of both PWI and PET. A random effects model was adopted because the heterogeneity was high (\u03c7 =70.90,   p  <0.00001, I =79%). The forest plot demonstrated that the sensitivity outcome was not significantly different between PWI and PET (RR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.85-1.06;   p  =0.32) ( ). \n  \n- Forest plot of the rate ratio of sensitivity between perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and positron emission tomography (PET).

The forest plot revealed that the specificity outcome was not significantly different between PWI and PET (RR=1.10, 95% CI: 0.98-1.23;   p  =0.12) ( ). \n  \n- Forest plot of the rate ratio of sensitivity between perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and positron emission tomography (PET). CI: confidence interval \n  \nExploratory subgroup analysis suggested that an only prospective study design was a cause of heterogeneity for the accuracy outcome (  p  =0.03). Regarding sensitivity, all parameters contributed to the heterogeneity, except the  F-FET and  C-methionine tracers (  p  =0.07). Similarly, all parameters caused heterogeneity for the specificity outcome, except the prospective study design (  p  =0.44) (Table 2). Additionally, we noticed that the 3 outcomes were not significantly different between PWI versus (vs) PET, PWI vs PET/CT, and PWI vs PET/MRI (  p  >0.05 for all). Interestingly, we revealed a significant difference in terms of accuracy and sensitivity when using the  F-FET tracer (  p  <0.05). Indeed,  F-FET-PET proved to be more efficient than PWI in differentiating recurrent tumors from treatment-related changes ( ). \n  \n- Forest plot showing the rate ratio of (  A  ) accuracy and (  B  ) sensitivity between PWI and positron emission tomography (PET). \n  \nA leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was conducted to detect the likely cause of heterogeneity in the pooled RR of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity between PWI and PET. The findings revealed that the outcomes did not differ noticeably, which indicates that this meta-analysis had solid precision. Indeed, the RRs of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity ranged from 0.93 (95% CI 0.79-1.01) to 0.98 (95% CI 0.89-1.10), from 0.93 (95% CI 0.80-1.02) to 1.04 (95% CI 0.93-1.17), and from 0.97 (95% CI 0.88-1.17) to 1.13 (95% CI 1.03-1.31), respectively. \n\nWe demonstrated no proof of publication bias for all 3 outcomes analyzed by using Egger\u2019s regression test (  p  >0.05). Moreover, visual inspection of the funnel plot revealed symmetry ( ). \n  \n- Funnel plot showing no publication bias in terms of (A) accuracy, (B) sensitivity, and (C) specificity among the studies. \n  \n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present systematic review and meta-analysis comprising 14 articles is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to assess the relative effectiveness of PWI and PET in the distinction between early recurrent tumors and changes related to treatment. Discriminating between treatment change and tumor recurrence has been a subject of expanded medical interest using diverse neuroimaging techniques. \n\nConsistent with previous research articles on the distinction between true tumor recurrence and treatment-related conditions, this systematic review and meta-analysis included articles of patients with suspected radiological progression at the site of previously irradiated brain tumors, at an interval not only <3 months but also >3 months after radiation therapy. In fact, treatment-related conditions are a wide class that consists of diverse well-defined clinical units regrouping pseudoprogression, as well as radiation necrosis and mixed response.  Pseudoprogression usually appears weeks to 3 months after the achievement of treatment, while radiation necrosis occurs in most cases 18-24 months to years afterward.  Hence, distinction of recurrent tumors from treatment-related alterations is challenging, since both disorders presented similar neurological signs.  Consequently, the prompt detection of recurrent tumors (within 3 months) allows physicians to choose between changes in chemotherapy and repeat surgery in order to ameliorate the patient\u2019s course. Standard MRI techniques have low efficiency, as revealed by Taghipour Zahir et al,  who revealed that MRI yielded a limited specificity of 25%.  Many studies have discussed the limitations of conventional imaging techniques in differentiating tumor progression/recurrence and immunotherapy responses in order to highlight the need for developing advanced imaging methods to overcome these limitations. \n\nConsequently, PWI, and PET have been used for their important role in differentiating recurrent tumors from treatment-related changes. Diverse research has evaluated the effect of amide proton transfer-weighted MRI or MR spectroscopy, investigating particular imaging parameters as important predictors of tumor recurrence. \n\nIn the present meta-analysis including 14 studies, PET and PWI were found to have the same effectiveness in distinguishing true tumor progression from treatment-related changes after radiation treatment, regardless of the modality or amino acid tracer used with PET. Positron emission tomography and PWI are promising techniques, but comparative studies on their effectiveness have shown heterogenous results in terms of early progression. Steidl et al  reported that PET could differentiate glioma progression from treatment-related changes with a specificity of just 62% against 100% for PWI.  Similarly, Seligman et al  revealed that the best-performing PET and PWI cutoffs achieved a specificity of 56% and 89%, respectively, indicating that PWI is more efficient than PET in detecting recurrent tumors.  In this context, Patel et al  demonstrated that PWI-derived thresholds differentiating true tumor progression from other conditions revealed high accuracy. Obviously, additional standardization and investigation are needed before adopting any specific PWI strategy, due to the significant variability in optimal reported thresholds. \n\nOn the other hand, some studies showed that PET was more efficient than PWI. For example, Cicone et al  revealed that PET was a highly accurate tool for differentiating brain radionecrosis from recurrent brain metastases after stereotactic radiosurgery, with a sensitivity of 93.3% and a specificity of 90.9%, which is higher than those yielded by PWI (86.7% and 68.2%, respectively).  Similar findings have been highlighted by Sacconi et al  who demonstrated that PET seems to outperform PWI in terms of specificity (89.7% vs 74%). \n\nRegarding the amino acid tracers used with PET, we have noticed that  F-FET-PET was more efficient than PWI in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. A previous meta-analysis demonstrated that 18F-FDG and  C-MET PET seemed to possess a relatively high accuracy for detecting the recurrence of gliomas.  Yet, studies investigating  F-FET and  F-FLT cited good sensitivity, especially for high-grade tumors. F-FET and  F-FLT are newly discovered PET tracers. Over the past years, they have been investigated in clinical use only. Only some studies have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of these tracers. Although pertinent findings have been cited, supplementary validations are required. Recently, de Zwart et al  carried out a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic performance of 11 PET tracers for the distinction of tumor recurrence from radiation-related alteration in high-grade tumors. The findings obtained showed that  F-FET and  C-MET had a higher sensitivity than  F-FDG in the distinction of recurrent tumors from radiation-related alterations. However, the evidence for the remaining tracers was limited. \n\nThe major advantage of PWI in comparison with PET in brain tumors include whole brain coverage and simpler post-processing methodology.  In addition, the software used to postprocess data yielded by PWI is broadly accessible and quite easy to use. Perfusion modalities present to the user the capacity to investigate the brain\u2019s microvasculature from a different perspective. This may provide a real evaluation of tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, perfusion MRI is a very safe imaging method, unlike PET which presents a risk of radiation exposure.  The main findings were that costs were significantly lower for PWI compared with PET in the evaluation of brain tumors. Perfusion-weighted imaging was economically attractive, especially because of fewer invasive processes, whereas PET was considered an expensive imaging test with a higher price and no notable difference in terms of sensitivity and specificity compared with PWI.   Consequently, PWI as a non-invasive, convenient and less expensive modality, seems to be the preferred imaging strategy in post-treatment surveillance of brain tumors. \n\n### Study limitation \n  \nThere are limited number of studies that compare other tracers or PET vs different neuroimaging techniques (such as, PWI). Thereby, research articles conducting head-to-head comparisons between PET tracers and alternative MR imaging techniques (such as, MR spectroscopy, DWI, and PWI or between different PET tracers) are particularly needed. \n\nIn the present study, we carried out literature searches in 5 different databases. The principal strong items of this article are the large scale of studies and considerable number of participants analyzed. Although unpublished articles were not included in our study, the funnel plot did not show a publication bias. Additionally, the sensitivity analyses showed that the estimated RR of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity outcomes were reliable and not effected when a single study was omitted. \n\n\n### Study limitation \n  \nThis meta-analysis relates to the elevated rate of heterogeneity between the articles. Regarding the subgroup analysis, heterogeneity could be likely due to differences in study design, PET modalities, and amino acid tracer used. These differences caused major difficulties in synthesizing all available studies. Hence, considerable heterogeneity, which is expected in meta-analysis studies, can alter the interpretability of results.  Consequently, the findings of the present work have to be analyzed with attentiveness. \n\nIn conclusion, PET and PWI show comparable accuracy, specificity and sensitivity in differentiating recurrent tumors from radiation-related alterations. Taking into account the advantages of PWI compared to PET in terms of safety, availability and cost, PWI seems to be more favorable than PET for the follow-up of patients. \n\nThese techniques presented conflicting results between some studies. Provided that the neuroimaging distinction between recurrent tumors and treatment-related changes represents a real challenge and has an impact on the choice of therapeutic strategy, supplementary works with larger sample sizes are required to produce more significant findings. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9424982, "text_md5": "6781143e39ee6984b471f37d45486d56", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 39], "journal": [40, 62], "publication_year": [64, 68], "title": [79, 182], "keywords": [196, 196], "abstract": [209, 2038], "body": [2047, 26807]}, "batch": 2, "doi": "10.17712/nsj.2022.3.20210146", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9424982", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9424982"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9424982\">9424982</a>", "list_title": "PMC9424982  Positron emission tomography and perfusion weighted imaging in the detection of brain tumors recurrence"}

Following the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (2016), the most important molecular diagnostic markers include IDH1/2-genotype and 1p/19q codeletion status, although more recent publications also include ARTX genotype and TERT- and MGMT promoter methylation. Machine learning algorithms (MLAs), however, were described to successfully determine these molecular characteristics non-invasively by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The aim of this review and meta-analysis was to define the diagnostic accuracy of MLAs with regard to these different molecular markers. We found high accuracies of MLAs to predict each individual molecular marker, with IDH1/2-genotype being the most investigated and the most accurate. Radiogenomics could therefore be a promising tool for discriminating genetically determined gliomas in a non-invasive fashion. Although encouraging results are presented here, large-scale, prospective trials with external validation groups are warranted. \n\n\n## Abstract \n  \nTreatment planning and prognosis in glioma treatment are based on the classification into low- and high-grade oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma, which is mainly based on molecular characteristics (IDH1/2- and 1p/19q codeletion status). It would be of great value if this classification could be made reliably before surgery, without biopsy. Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) could play a role in achieving this by enabling glioma characterization on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data without invasive tissue sampling. The aim of this study is to provide a performance evaluation and meta-analysis of various MLAs for glioma characterization. Systematic literature search and meta-analysis were performed on the aggregated data, after which subgroup analyses for several target conditions were conducted. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020191033. We identified 724 studies; 60 and 17 studies were eligible to be included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Meta-analysis showed excellent accuracy for all subgroups, with the classification of 1p/19q codeletion status scoring significantly poorer than other subgroups (AUC: 0.748,   p   = 0.132). There was considerable heterogeneity among some of the included studies. Although promising results were found with regard to the ability of MLA-tools to be used for the non-invasive classification of gliomas, large-scale, prospective trials with external validation are warranted in the future. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nThe most common primary brain tumor\u2014glioma\u2014is a rare cancer, but it is invariably fatal despite surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. While primary central nervous system tumors account for only 2% of primary tumors, they cause 7% of the years of life lost from cancer before age 70 [ , , ]. Current glioma classification is based on the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which differentiates subtypes of gliomas based on the presence or absence of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status. In addition to the mutation status, cytologic features and degrees of malignancy after hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining are also evaluated ( ). Over the years, various other molecular biomarkers have been reported in the scientific literature, which led the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) to consider it necessary to update its guideline for the management of adult patients with gliomas [ ]. \n\nImproved differentiation between the different subtypes of oligodendroglial tumors and astrocytic tumors based on neuroimaging would be beneficial, as this would facilitate the treatment planning, such as the extent of the resection margins and radiotherapy field [ ]. Molecular characteristics of glioma have been shown to represent hallmark features that help clinicians to accurately define the nature of the neoplasm. For example, primary glioblastomas are characterized by a distinct pattern of genetic aberrations when compared with secondary glioblastomas, which develop by degeneration of pre-existing lower-grade gliomas [ ]. Moreover, molecular characteristics are known to impact the effectiveness of certain treatment options and can therefore help to identify the most suitable treatment strategy for each patient individually [ , ]. Finally, the different subtypes of glioma are known to have different survival rates [ , ]. With regard to prognosis, patients suffering from a grade II glioma with an oligodendroglial origin have a 5-year survival rate of 81%, whereas those suffering from a grade II astrocytic glioma have a 5-year survival rate of 40%. When classified as WHO grade III, oligodendroglial tumors have better 5-year survival rates as compared to astrocytic tumors (43% vs. 20%, respectively). The patients suffering from glioblastoma (grade IV) have the poorest outcomes, with a 5-year survival rate of 5.5% [ ]. In terms of treatment, preoperative distinguishing of oligodendroglial tumors from astrocytic tumors would be beneficial in facilitating the planning, extent of the resection, and the radiotherapy field [ ]. Unfortunately, no visual features have yet been proven accurately enough to circumvent histopathological assessment after neurosurgical intervention. Application of machine learning algorithms (MLAs), however, could be helpful in the non-invasive characterization of gliomas [ ]. \n\nAs previously predicted, MLAs are increasingly becoming a critical component of advanced software systems in radiology [ , ]. MLAs concern medical imaging analysis carried out by (automatic) feature selection, followed by automatic classification. These processes detect complex patterns in images elusive to the eyes of neuroradiologists and make predictions that surpass human intelligence and human-level performance. In general, input data for MLAs consist of the imaging data themselves (e.g., different MRI sequences) and/or the segmentation of the regions of interest. Output data, on the other hand, are the desired parameters that should be extracted from the imaging data [ , , ]. In general, the dataset is divided into two different sets: the training and the test set. The training set is used to train the performance of the MLA, indicating that the MLA is attempting to elucidate an often complex relationship between input data and output data. The test set is then used to test the actual performance of the data on a new dataset, indicating that the network has not yet been able to train on these data. The term \u201ctest set\u201d is often used interchangeably with \u201cvalidation\u201d set. Nevertheless, only a small amount of MLAs are actually validated on a completely different, external dataset, which significantly hampers the further development of the integration of MLAs in daily practice [ ].  \n\nWith regard to the use of MLAs in neuro-oncology imaging, various reports on the use of MLAs, using a broad range of extracted features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), showed promising results with regard to the prediction of molecular markers and genetic alterations (e.g., IDH genotype, 1p/19q codeletion status, P53 mutations, MGMT promoter mutation, TERT promoter mutation, BRAF status, EGFR receptor mutations) [ , , , , , ]. However, one of the limitations of this type of research is the relatively limited amount of data in each study, which could possibly be overcome by a systematic review and meta-analysis of the aggregated study results [ ]. The purpose of this study was to provide such an overview and perform a meta-analysis of the accuracy of MLAs in predicting gliomas\u2019 genotype. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Guidelines and Registration  \n  \nA systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [ ]. Prior to the initiation of the review, the study protocol was registered in the international open-access Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under the number CRD42020191033. \n\n\n### 2.2. Search Strategy, Inclusion Criteria, and Exclusion Criteria \n  \nPapers describing the use of MLAs for the binary classification of molecular characteristics of gliomas were reviewed. Databases searched for literature included Medline (accessed through PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Searches were conducted from 1 April 2020 to 24 January 2021. Search strings are made available in the   and were included when they discussed the use of classification MLA methodologies on MR images in glioma patients. Next, papers must report results as mean accuracy and/or mean area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC). Papers were excluded from this review when they discussed findings in animal-based studies or in non-human samples. In addition, MLA models needed to be at least internally validated. Letters, preprints, scientific reports, and reviews were included. After the removal of duplicates, the remaining papers were systematically screened on title and abstract by two researchers (E.v.K. and D.H.) independently. Non-consensus papers were identified and discussed by two researchers (E.v.K. and D.H.) to resolve disagreements and to reach consensus. Formal quality assessment tools are still lacking for this type of research [ ], although a version of the TRIPOD statement tailored to machine learning methods has been announced [ ]. \n\nStandardized tables were used to acquire the information of interest from the included articles. Data extracted from each study were (a) first author and year of publication, (b) size of the training set, (c) mean age of participants in the training set, (d) sex of participants in the training set, (e) size of the validation set, (f) whether there was an external validation, (g) study design, (h) architecture of the MLA algorithm(s), (i) target condition, (j) performance of the algorithm(s). Performance of the classification tools was expressed in accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity for both the training and the validation set. For studies performing external validation, externally validated data were displayed. Extracted data were cross-checked afterward, and discrepancies were resolved. \n\n\n### 2.3. Statistical Analysis \n  \nMeta-analysis was conducted on the papers, which included the AUC \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) using a random-effects model to estimate the performance of the included MLA methodologies. For inclusion in quantitative analysis, studies must have reported a standard deviation, 95% confidence interval (CI), or standard error, along with the AUC-value. For the meta-analysis, the standard deviation was derived from the standard error or 95%-CI for studies not reporting the standard deviation [ ]. If not provided, corresponding authors were contacted with the request to provide the necessary data to be included in the meta-analysis. Results of all appropriate studies were combined to meta-analyze the aggregated data. Then, meta-analyses were conducted on different subgroups of target conditions in order to estimate the accuracy of the algorithm for each condition separately. To be included in subgroup analysis, an additional criterium for the included studies was to describe a specific target condition (e.g., IDH and 1p/19q). Meta-analysis was performed with the use of IBM SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp. Released 2017. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) and OpenMeta[Analyst] software (MetaAnalyst, Brown University EPBC [ ]), which is the visual front-end for the R package (version 12.11.14) [ ]. Results were displayed in forest plots. AUC-values of subgroups were compared by looking at the 95% confidence intervals and whether there was any overlap. The Higgins I2-test was used to test for heterogeneity between included studies with I2 > 75% deemed as considerable heterogeneity [ ]. The Egger regression analysis was carried out to test for publication bias [ ]. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \nA total of 1094 publications were initially retrieved through literature searches, and 724 remained after the removal of duplicates. After title and abstract screening, 215 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. After a full-text assessment, 60 and 17 studies were included for the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively ( ). A total of 155 studies were excluded based on the full-text assessment for the following reasons: 66 studies described the segmentation of tumor-area instead of the classification of glioma; 23 studies did not report AUC as a performance metric; 14 studies discussed the classification of texture features instead of molecular characteristics of glioma; 14 studies had an incomplete description of the published data and/or methods; 14 studies did not describe an MLA model, but instead a number of combined features; 13 studies reported a too specific target condition (e.g., H3K27M and Ki-67); 5 studies used imaging techniques other than MR imaging; 3 studies had no internal validation-group; 3 studies included other brain tumors besides glioma. \n\n### 3.1. Review of the Included Studies \n  \nA total of 60 studies [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ] were included after the eligibility assessment.   shows the participant demographics and study characteristics. The performance evaluation of the MLA algorithms in terms of accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity for the validation set is displayed in  , organized by target condition subgroups. For 12 of the included studies, an external out-of-sample validation was carried out [ , , , , , , , , , , , ], all other studies performed internal validation only. \n\nDue to the high dimensionality and complexity of MRI data using different sequences, two critical steps were used to reduce the computational power needed to carry out such complex analyses. Feature selection was one key step in the discovery of predictors from high-throughput features. The included imaging genomics studies built their classification models by selecting a set of non-redundant features. The second step consists of applying a dimensionality reduction method. Often, unimodal methods are used for each dataset separately, thus failing to properly extract important, though subtle, interactions between various sequences. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method was discussed most often to perform dimensionality reduction [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. With regard to feature selection, most papers discussed the use of a support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) method [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. The Lasso method was another often mentioned method to select features [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ]. Other methods, which were frequently used for feature selection, concerned random forest classification algorithms [ , , , , , , , , , , , ], convolutional neural networks [ , , , , , , , , , , , , ], and/or logistic regression models [ , , , ].  \n\nFor the target condition, 22 studies focused on IDH mutation status, 6 on 1p/19q codeletion status, 11 on MGMT promoter methylation status, 3 on TP53 mutation status, 1 on the PTEN gene mutation, 2 on ATRX gene mutation status, 3 on the TERT promoter mutation, and 20 on the differentiation between different subtypes of glioma. Five of the included studies described multiple target conditions and/or multiple tested MLA models, each of those presented separately in  . The included classification studies showed different references in classifying the presence or absence of the outcome of interest, such as standard-of-care diagnosis, (immuno)histopathology, and expert consensus. Twenty-two studies [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ] focused on classifying the IDH mutation status in glioma. Mutations of the IDH genes serve as a diagnostic marker to diffuse WHO grade II and III gliomas as well as secondary glioblastomas. They are associated with a better prognosis in these gliomas [ ]. One included study described two separate MLA methods, and therefore 23 methodologies could be analyzed. All studies used retrospectively collected data, and three [ , , ] carried out external validation. Five studies did not report a validated AUC-value. Performance evaluation from the remaining 17 [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ] studies in terms of the validated AUC ranged from 0.75 to 0.99. Additionally, 14 studies [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , ] presented the sensitivity and the specificity ranging from 54% to 98% and 67% to 99%, respectively. \n\nSix studies [ , , , , , ] described the classification of the 1p/19q codeletion status in glioma patients, all using retrospectively collected data. The 1p/19q codeletion status is associated with better prognosis in patients with (oligodendro)glial tumors receiving adjuvant radio-chemotherapy [ ]. One study [ ] included an external validation. Validated AUC for classifying 1p/19q codeletion status ranged from 0.72 to 0.87 (  n   = 5) [ , , , , ]. The range of the sensitivity and the specificity were 68% to 92% and 71% to 85%, respectively (  n   = 5) [ , , , , ]. \n\nRegarding the classification of the MGMT promoter methylation status, all studies (  n   = 11) [ , , , , , , , , , , ] used retrospectively collected data and two studies [ , ] had been externally validated. The importance of the MGMT promoter methylation status can be found in the fact that it is a predictive variable for the response of GBM to alkylating chemotherapy [ ]. Seven studies [ , , , , , , ] reported the validated AUC-value, which ranged from 0.54 to 0.90. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity ranged from 67% to 94% and 54% to 97%, respectively (  n   = 7) [ , , , , , , ]. \n\nThree studies [ , , ] were included that described the classification of the TERT promoter mutation status in glioma. All studies used retrospectively collected data, and one study [ ] was externally validated. Although still under investigation, it has been suggested that TERT promoter mutations characterize gliomas that require aggressive treatment [ ]. All studies reported the validated AUC (range: 0.82\u20130.89). Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity ranged from 71% to 77% and 86% to 91%, respectively (  n   = 3). \n\n\n### 3.2. Meta-Analysis of the Included Studies \n  \nFor the classification papers, 17 out of the 60 were eligible for the meta-analysis. In total, 22 MLA methodologies, described in 17 individual studies [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ] were retrieved. Meta-analysis was performed separately in subgroups for different target conditions. For inclusion in this subgroup meta-analysis, studies must focus on a specific target condition (i.e., IDH genotype, 1p/19q codeletion and MGMT- and TERT promoter status). \n\nFor the subgroup meta-analysis of the classification studies with a focus on IDH mutation status, eight MLA algorithms, originating from seven studies [ , , , , , , ], were included. Results show an overall AUC of 0.909 (95%-CI: 0.867\u20130.951), as seen in  . Moreover, heterogeneity between groups, measured with Higgins I2, was estimated as 90.402% (  p   < 0.001). \n\nThe forest plot shows that the performance of the MLAs to classify molecular characteristics of glioma are centered around an AUC of 0.858 with a 95%-CI ranging from 0.812\u20130.904. \n\nThree studies [ , , ] were included in the subgroup meta-analysis of the 1p/19q codeletion status. Results of this subgroup analysis are displayed in  . The overall AUC is 0.748 (95%-CI: 0.699\u20130.797). Heterogeneity between groups was considered moderate (Higgins I2= 50.655% (  p   = 0.132)). \n\nSubgroup meta-analysis of MGMT promoter methylation status included three studies [ , , ]; see   for an overview of the results. The overall AUC of these MLA models was estimated as 0.866 (95%-CI: 0.812\u20130.921). Heterogeneity between the included studies was considered very low (Higgins I2= 0% (  p   = 0.453)). \n\nThree studies [ , , ] were included in the subgroup analysis of the TERT promoter mutation status.   displays the results of the meta-analysis with an estimated overall AUC of 0.842 (95%-CI: 0.783\u20130.901) and considered a low I2 heterogeneity of 0% (  p   = 0.582). \n\nClassification of the 1p/19q codeletion status showed to have a significantly poorer AUC when compared to other subgroup classifications, except for the TERT mutation status classification. No significant differences in performance between the other three subgroups (i.e., IDH, MGMT, TERT) were observed due to overlap of the 95% confidence intervals. \n\n\n### 3.3. Testing for Publication Bias \n  \nEgger\u2019s regression test showed no significant publication bias with regard to MLAs to predict the molecular status of gliomas (  p   = 0.235). \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nIn this study, a number of studies that describe the classification of gliomas with the use of MLAs were reviewed and meta-analyzed. The overall performance of the classification tools as reported in AUC-values showed to be excellent. Subgroup analysis showed that the classification of 1p/19q codeletion status was significantly poorer than the classification performance of other molecular markers (i.e., IDH and MGMT). The observed heterogeneity between the included studies in the IDH-subgroup was considerably high. \n\nThe binary classification of various molecular characteristics of glioma with the use of artificial intelligence showed promising results with regard to future implementation in clinical practice. This implementation will have a significant impact on the care of glioma patients, as it could help to stratify patients for treatment options prior to undergoing surgery. However, clinically relevant studies need to be undertaken to increase the impact of these techniques in daily practice. For example, predicting 1p/19q codeletion status is more relevant in a subset of low-grade gliomas, as it enables to non-invasively distinguish IDH-mut astrocytoma (1p/19q intact) from oligodendroglioma (1p/19q codeleted) [ ]. This is clinically relevant as the median survival of patients with these glioma subtypes is significantly different and can be impacted by the extent of the neurosurgical resection [ , ]. In addition, to further verify the performance of MLA methodologies, larger-scale multi-center studies using prospective data are required. Moreover, despite the growing knowledge and use of MLA methodologies, integration in widespread clinical practice still faces some challenges [ ]. One major challenge for this implementation concerns the generalizability of these systems, as they are mostly trained on small datasets lacking external validation [ ]. Considering external validation as an additional inclusion criterium for a sub-analysis, we found that no meta-analysis could be performed. The twelve papers included in this review which validated their results externally investigated IDH mutation status (  n   = 2), 1p/19q codeletion status (  n   = 1), MGMT promoter methylation status (  n   = 2), PTEN gene mutation (  n   = 1), ATRX gene mutation (  n   = 1), TERT promoter mutation (  n   = 1), and various predictions with regard to WHO grading (  n   = 4), indicating that no pooled data can be acquired from these individual studies. Although the computer-aided classification of glioma holds great potential, computer-obtained diagnosis is not likely to replace histopathologic diagnosis in the near future. \n\n### 4.1. Implementation of Computer-Aided Approaches in Future Medicine \n  \nThe diagnosis of different diseases by the use of MLAs is believed to hold great potential in modern medicine. The number of retrieved papers on this narrow topic is relatively limited, especially when compared to other reviews with a broader scope with regard to the use of artificial analysis in medical imaging analysis [ ]. Nevertheless, conclusions and major limitations seem to be similar across fields. We can cautiously state that the accuracy of MLAs in the non-invasive classification of glioma holds great potential and is equal to or better than the predictions of healthcare professionals. On the other hand, the lack of external validation of the obtained results was recognized as the major limitation of the current scientific literature. Additionally, poor reporting is known to be prevalent in MLA studies, which limits reliable interpretation of the reported diagnostic accuracy and thereby hampers clinical implementation. Improving reporting and publication will enable greater confidence in the results of future evaluations of these promising technologies in medicine. When such improved confidence will be achieved, prospective evaluation should be carried out in the context of an intended clinical pathway. With regard to the context discussed in this paper, MLAs could be used on the preoperative imaging data, after which the predicted outcomes can be compared to the histopathological assessment after biopsy. Such implementation will help to elucidate whether important unknown covariates were present in the retrospective studies reviewed here. Thereafter, a randomized comparison could help to reveal and quantify possible clinical implications of implementing these MLAs in daily practice. \n\nFurthermore, as recently suggested by Bhandari et al., a greater effort is needed to start translating these findings into an interpretable format for clinical radiology [ ]. In addition, as several studies focused on singular molecular biomarkers in gliomas, it must be underlined several molecular alterations in astrocytic, oligodendroglial gliomas can occur in different combinations [ ]. Consequently, a growing number of (and a combination of) different molecular tests are used to provide clinically relevant tissue-based biomarkers. Furthermore, the performance of MLAs to grade glioma according to the WHO grading score remains restricted by the interobserver variability of the neuropathological examination as reviewed by Van den Bent (2010) [ ]. This clinically significant interobserver variation of the histological grading of glioma limits the diagnostic performance of other diagnostic tests (e.g., MLAs) as the neuropathological assessment was considered to be the ground truth. \n\n\n### 4.2. Clinical Relevance of Computer-Aided Diagnosis \n  \nAutomated diagnosis from medical imaging through artificial intelligence could help to overcome the mismatch between the increasing amount of diagnostic images and the capacity of available specialists [ ]. More than 100 MLAs have now CE-marked, 57 of which can be used within neuroimaging features. Only four of these MLAs have been tailored to be used on neuro-oncology practices [ ] (see  ; accessed on 5 March 2021). Only one of these software packages claims to aid in tumor differentiation (The Brain Tumours Application; Hanalytics (BioMind;  ; accessed on 5 March 2021). This application focuses on the differentiation of 22 types of intracranial tumors on MRI scans, including the differentiation of astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and glioblastoma. Therefore, no software is commercially present to distinguish different molecular subtypes of glioma. Therefore, we conclude that the use of MLA models in daily radiological practice to non-invasively predict glioma subtype remains an important topic of future research in order to improve accuracy and commence external validation [ ]. \n\n\n### 4.3. Strengths and Limitations  \n  \nMeta-analysis of the aggregated MLA models showed high heterogeneity between included study groups. This heterogeneity could be expected, as multiple subgroups of target conditions are included in this analysis. Subgroup meta-analyses show significantly lower heterogeneity among included groups. However, for the IDH-subgroup, estimated heterogeneity still is remarkably high (I2 > 80%). Possible explanations for this heterogeneity could be the inclusion of multiple technically different MLA methodologies, multiple included MRI protocols with different sequences (e.g., T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted), and the fact that there were no specific criteria set for the target population of glioma patients. The latter indicates that there is a good chance of variety between the included groups of patients. Although not supported by the results of the Egger\u2019s regression test, the presence of publication bias is not unlikely, there being little interest for classification tools with poor performance. The analyzed MLA methodologies showed excellent accuracy in the classification of multiple molecular characteristics of glioma. However, some deficiencies in the methods of this study should be considered. The quality of included articles was not formally assessed because no sufficient assessment tool is currently available for prediction models using MLA-techniques. The previously announced MLA variant of the TRIPOD statement could possibly be the solution to this problem for future research [ ]. Moreover, external validation of the MLA methodologies was conducted for only 12 of the 60 studies. As internal validation commonly overestimates the performance, external validation of the described system is highly preferred. Lastly, a large number of the studies found in the initial search had missing reports of the validated AUC-value. Therefore, plural studies needed to be excluded from this review. Moreover, out of 60 studies included for qualitative synthesis, 43 studies did not note the 95% confidence interval, standard error, and/or standard deviation, which led to a restriction in the number of studies eligible for meta-analysis. For this matter, we recommend a standardized way of reporting MLA findings. In addition, as MLAs are statistical model-fitting methods, the reliability and performance of each study are at least partially dependent on the study sample size. Therefore, a large dataset next to the available BraTS dataset would be indispensable for this field of research. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nThis systematic review and meta-analysis show good accuracy for various MLA methodologies for the classification of molecular characteristics of gliomas, which could be beneficial for treatment planning. Remarkably, various studies did not perform external validation, causing significant limitations for these study results. Quality guidelines should be used when publishing studies on MLAs, including out-of-sample external validation and standardized reporting of obtained results. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8198025, "text_md5": "f34c51e23c4a0b0eb3931240c2f33eed", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 144], "journal": [145, 160], "publication_year": [162, 166], "title": [177, 329], "keywords": [343, 430], "abstract": [443, 3064], "body": [3073, 31180]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 34073309, "doi": "10.3390/cancers13112606", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8198025", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8198025"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8198025\">8198025</a>", "list_title": "PMC8198025  Accuracy of Machine Learning Algorithms for the Classification of Molecular Features of Gliomas on MRI: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis"}

However, the neural substrates of non-conscious processing have not been entirely elucidated. Examining the differential effects of arousing stimuli that are consciously, versus unconsciously perceived will improve our knowledge of neural circuitry involved in non-conscious perception. Here we conduct preliminary analyses of neural activation in studies that have used both subliminal and supraliminal presentation of the same stimulus. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe use Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) to examine functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies that uniquely present the same stimuli subliminally and supraliminally to healthy participants during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We included a total of 193 foci from 9 studies representing subliminal stimulation and 315 foci from 10 studies representing supraliminal stimulation. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe anterior cingulate cortex is significantly activated during both subliminal and supraliminal stimulus presentation. Subliminal stimuli are linked to significantly increased activation in the right fusiform gyrus and right insula. Supraliminal stimuli show significantly increased activation in the left rostral anterior cingulate. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nNon-conscious processing of arousing stimuli may involve primary visual areas and may also recruit the insula, a brain area involved in eventual interoceptive awareness. The anterior cingulate is perhaps a key brain region for the integration of conscious and non-conscious processing. These preliminary data provide candidate brain regions for further study in to the neural correlates of conscious experience. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40359-014-0052-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nRecent brain imaging evidence suggests that subliminal stimuli can alter behavior, via non-conscious processes (Muscarella et al.  ; Eimer & Schlaghecken  ). Neural models of behavior elicited by non-conscious stimuli implicate the prefrontal and cingulate cortices in the regulation of subcortical brain regions linked to impulsive and largely non-conscious stimulus perception (Ochsner et al.  ). In this way therefore, one might suggest that conscious cognitive processes, such as decision-making and working memory that are associated with prefrontal cortex networks, are influenced by non-conscious experiences. William James and Carl Lange, who were the first to provide theories for non-conscious processes in the decision making capabilities of the human mind, postulated the importance of physiological mechanisms that are not at first consciously perceived, e.g. that physiological changes in the body following an event lead to a response that drives one\u2019s conscious decision-making processes (Cannon,  ). Some of James and Lang\u2019s views are in line with contemporary notions of the unconscious mind, and some of these theories are beginning to be reflected in neuroimaging studies (19, 21, 52). \n\nProcessing of non-conscious physiological responses in the body by the cortex is a view that has been incorporated into many contemporary theories. One example by Damasio (54) and Tranel (55) proposes that emotions, which help us to make decisions, are cognitive stories constructed by the cortex in a particular context to explain bodily arousal; a view reflected in their recently updated Somatic Marker Hypothesis, highlighting the importance of brainstem (e.g. the periaquaductal gray) activation in conscious experience (Damasio  ; Panksepp  ). Perception of heart rate variability, a largely automatic physiological process, can also influence the modulation of cognitions and emotions (Kim et al.  ). Others suggest overlapping but different neural circuitry in consciousness, incorporating brain processing in both non-conscious subcortical and conscious prefrontal regions respectively (Ochsner et al.  ). Against this background, non-consciously perceived stimuli we hypothesise, should therefore activate different brain regions to stimuli that are consciously perceived. \n\nA recent qualitative review of subliminal findings in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) research reports that non-consciously perceived stimuli can influence perceptual, lexical and semantic processing, but that the neural response to subliminal stimuli depends on the strength of stimulus presentation, as well as individual differences in threshold for conscious perception (Kouider & Dehaene  ). Furthermore, this review distinguishes between subliminal and preconscious awareness, which may be reflected in varying degrees of cortical versus subcortical recruitment, although the various paradigms used to measure this limit the conclusions. Another recent review revealed that the non-conscious processing of motor responses involves the precuneus and supplementary motor areas, whereas subjective experience of voluntary action may involve fronto-parietal network activation (D'Ostilio & Garraux  ). A recent review of electrophysiological evidence of brain function shows that error detection, a psychological function often associated with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) occurs non-consciously (Shalgi & Deouell  ). Thus, there is now ample neurobiological evidence to suggest that conscious and unconscious processing may have some overlap, but that the origins may occur independently and in specific brain areas. However, there has been no meta-analysis of fMRI studies that measure different degrees of conscious perception using the same stimulus. \n\nSubliminal neuroimaging paradigms using masked and thus non-consciously perceived stimuli provide a potential method to progress knowledge of the neural correlates of non-conscious, primary processes in the brain. For example, a recent meta-analysis of functional fMRI studies has shown that subliminal arousing (versus subliminal neutral) stimuli evoke distinct activations in primary visual areas, somatosensory regions, implicit memory and conflict monitoring systems independent of conscious awareness of the stimulus (Brooks et al.  ). This large meta-analysis demonstrated a distinct lack of prefrontal cortex activation in response to non-consciously perceived stimuli. However, this review did not explicitly analyze differential neural activation to the same conscious, versus - unconsciously perceived arousing stimuli, which would go some way to delineate which regions are involved in conscious processing. While there is variability in fMRI methods, in terms of the contrasts applied, participants studied, stimulus presentation employed, coordinate systems adopted (e.g. MNI, Talairach, AFNI), statistical analyses used, a basic meta-analysis of fMRI data can yield useful data with Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) (Laird et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ; Eickhoff et al.  ; Turkeltaub et al.  ). ALE is a method that is currently being used extensively in the neuroimaging field. However, no meta-analysis has yet examined differential neural activation in fMRI studies measuring conscious (supraliminal) versus unconscious (subliminal) perception of the same stimulus. By doing so, we might provide a preliminary delineation of activated brain regions associated with conscious versus non-conscious perception, to guide further studies in the field. \n\nHere, we are the first to conduct an exploratory analysis of brain regions in healthy subjects that are activated to subliminal and supraliminal stimuli. We use the ALE approach to meta-analyse fMRI studies reporting neural activation in response to both the subliminal and supraliminal presentation of the same stimulus. Specifically, we meta-analyse only those fMRI study publications that used the same stimuli (but at different perception thresholds) with the same participants and the same experimental conditions within the same publication. In all studies included, subliminal perception was confirmed by a forced choice task. This meta-analysis differs from our recently published meta-analysis where only fMRI studies using subliminal stimuli (arousing versus neutral) were included with no activation to supraliminal perception (Brooks et al.  ). \n\nBy contrast, this meta-analysis attempts to answer a different question: how does conscious cognitive modulation of a stimulus, relative to the same stimulus being perceived unconsciously, alter brain activation? By illustrating here the core clusters of neural activation across studies that contrast the level of subjective awareness of a stimulus, we aim to delineate the regions associated with conscious experience from regional activation associated with stimulus perception that is not at first consciously experienced. In line with contemporary theories and our recent meta-analyses, we hypothesise that consciously perceived stimuli will activate prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex regions linked to conscious cognitive evaluation, whereas the same unconsciously perceived stimuli will provoke relatively greater activation in subcortical brain regions linked to implicit memory and arousal, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, striatum and primary visual cortex. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Searching \n  \n#### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nPubMed, Medline, Ovid, Sciencedirect, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched, and hand searches of reference lists up to October 2013. Search terms for online searches included fMRI and MRI, with subliminal and supraliminal stimulation as our search criteria. To be included in our meta-analysis, studies met the following criteria: a) studies were published within the last decade, between January 2001 to October 2013, b) published in a peer-reviewed journal, c) used a task that utilized both the subliminal and supraliminal presentation of the   same   arousing stimulus, c) the study included a direct contrast between brain activation to subliminal and supraliminal stimulus presentation, d) were original articles written in English, e) used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and not other brain imaging modalities (e.g. Positron Emission Tomography, [PET], Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation [TMS]) so that the data could be better aggregated for meta-analysis, and f) reported the neural activation coordinates in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space (Talairach & Tournoux  ). Studies examining people with physiological conditions who were without a psychiatric comorbid diagnosis were included (Irritable Bowel Syndrome, IBS, Gastro-esophageal reflux disease, GERD). We excluded otherwise eligible fMRI studies that only used Region of Interest (ROI) analysis as there is robust evidence that these studies artificially inflate ALE analyses (Eickhoff et al.  ). Study selection was done by three researchers (PM, SJB and HBS) and cross-checked between them. For a list of excluded studies, see Additional file  : Table S1. For details of our meta-analysis MOOSE checklist inclusions, see Additional file  : Table S2. \n\n\n#### Selected studies \n  \nWe found 77 studies that were initially screened for inclusion in the systematic review, but 20 of these did not meet the eligibility criteria described above. Of these 57 eligible studies, 13 were not included in the meta-analyses because they did not provide details of Talairach or MNI peak activation coordinates, and we were not able to contact the authors. Of the 44 fMRI studies to date, only 16 of these explicitly analyzed contrasts between subliminal and supraliminal thresholds of the same arousing stimulus or analyzed subliminal/supraliminal stimulation with a methodology similar to the one used in studies implying direct comparison between two different kinds of stimulation (the other studies compared only subliminal neutral vs. subliminal arousing stimuli). Of the 16 remaining studies with subliminal vs. supraliminal studies with some overlap in studies presenting both subliminal and supraliminal stimuli, 6 of these were excluded because they used exclusively Region of Interest (ROI) analysis, a technique that analyzes only a small region of the brain, based on a priori hypotheses. This is in contrast to a Whole Brain (WB) analysis, which statistically analyzes activation across the whole brain in one analysis. Thus, this left 10 WB fMRI studies that specifically included brain imaging coordinates for both subliminal and supraliminal perception, uniquely, of the same affective stimulus. It must be noted that one of the 10 studies directly compared subliminal with supraliminal presentation of the same stimulus, but only reported differential activation in the supraliminal condition, resulting in 9 studies contributing to the subliminal condition, and 10 studies contributing to the supraliminal condition. We included studies that either provided a direct comparison between subliminal versus supraliminal stimulation, or compared against a neutral condition (thus biasing the activation reported towards either subliminal or supraliminal perception). See Table\u00a0  for a list of included studies.   \n List of studies included in the ALE meta-analyses  \n  \nBlock design fMRI,  Event-related fMRI, n\u2009=\u2009number of participants, foci\u2009=\u2009number of separate Talairach coordinates contributing to the meta-analysis, n\u2009=\u2009number of participants, WB\u2009=\u2009Whole Brain Analysis, S.D.\u2009=\u2009Standard deviation. Note: all participants had no psychiatric comorbidities. \n  \n\n\n#### Definition of subliminal and supraliminal stimuli \n  \nFMRI studies included in this meta-analysis contrast neural activation to subliminal and supraliminal presentation of the same stimuli (see Table\u00a0  for details of the contrast for each study). Contemporary definitions of subliminal stimulation purport that stimuli are rendered subliminal if the stimuli are not perceived consciously by the participant (20,31,32). Subliminal stimulation is, in comparison to consciously-perceived stimulation, relatively weak and of low-intensity, suggesting that the neural processes driving unconsciously-perceived stimuli are less sophisticated and at the lower-order of function (Bargh & Morsella  ). The effects of subliminal stimuli can now be measured in brain imaging studies, examining the brain processes involved. Subliminal stimulation is not accessible to conscious introspection, which means that the presentation of such stimuli cannot be consciously recollected (Shalgi & Deouell  ). Subliminal presentation is most often achieved by a brief stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) usually not more than 50\u00a0ms, followed by a \u2018masking\u2019 procedure. Backward masking is the most common, where another stimulus is presented directly after the subliminal stimulus, preventing conscious perception (Breitmeyer et al.  ). In the present search, all studies included in the review presented the same stimulus both at a subliminal and a supraliminal level (see Table\u00a0 ). \n\n\n#### Quantitative data synthesis: ALE meta-analyses \n  \nTo examine relative activation to the subliminal and supraliminal presentation of arousing stimuli, we conducted two separate meta-analyses using BrainMap GingerALE version 2.3.1 software (Laird et al.  ). The ALE method is a voxel-wise technique which provides information from convergence in the spatial location of neural correlates across studies. Neural correlates, or foci from included studies become \u201cactivation likelihoods\u201d for each voxel in the brain and, for each one ALE gives a score using a three-dimensional Gaussian probability density function doing an estimation considering also the number of subjects in each study. The Gaussian distributions are then summed across studies to generate a map that estimate the likelihood of activation for each voxel (Laird et al.  ; Turkeltaub et al.  ). We applied the updated version of the ALE approach (Eickhoff et al.  ) to conduct the meta-analyses using Talairach coordinates (\u201cfoci\u201d) from neuroimaging results and converting Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates in to Talairach for the analysis using GingerALE software. As suggested by Eickhoff et al. in their technical note (28) we used a threshold of p\u2009<\u20090.05 with cluster-level corrected inference using p\u2009<\u20090.001 uncorrected at voxel-level as the cluster-forming threshold. This was to ensure that only highly significant clusters were reported. We used an anatomical image overlay program called Mango (Creators, Jack Lancaster, Michael Martinez:  ) to illustrate the results of our meta-analyses, using the Colin27_T1_seg_MNI template provided on the GingerALE website ( ).

When interpreting these findings, the categories and differences between visual and tactile stimulation must be considered with caution, as they may influence the data observed. Specifically, left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was most significantly activated across all studies when supraliminal processing was the reported activation; the right fusiform gyrus/middle occipital gyrus and right insula when subliminal processing was reported, and the caudal anterior cingulate cortex to both levels of perception. Additionally, it appears that subliminal stimulation most often activates regions of the right hemisphere, whereas in contrast, supraliminal stimulation appears to activate the left hemisphere. This is intriguing given that the right hemisphere is typically associated with emotional processing, whereas the left hemisphere is linked to language processing and higher level emotional processing that is largely consciously perceived (Bauer et al.  ; Shobe  ). This could suggest that conscious processing is linked to left hemisphere, language-based processing, such as cognitive labeling, whereas the right hemisphere maybe more associated with non-conscious processing of one\u2019s \u2018gut-feelings\u2019 and instincts. However, the different stimuli included in these meta-analyses may have influenced the results, and were: auditory tones (although these were under-represented in the final meta-analysis); rectal stimulation; famous, angry and disgusted faces and sexual images. Nevertheless, all of these types of stimuli have in common that they stimulate sensations in the peripheral nervous system. \n\nOur hypotheses, that consciously perceived stimuli activate prefrontal cortex regions, in comparison to unconscious perception of the same stimuli, were partially supported, in that the ACC can be regarded as part of the prefrontal cortex system. However, we did not, as expected, find subcortical regions (e.g. amygdala, hippocampus, striatum) being activated to non-consciously presented stimuli, but instead found that the right fusiform gyrus and right insula cortices were most significantly activated by subliminal stimuli. However, again it must be considered that these observations could be due to the type of stimuli used (e.g. faces and rectal stimulation), rather than as a consequence of variance in conscious perception. Most other fMRI studies using subliminal paradigms compare subliminal arousing to subliminal neutral stimuli, but the studies included in this review only compared supraliminal and subliminal presentation of the same stimulus within the same study (Brooks et al.  ). The preliminary findings we present here for the first time compare neural activation to conscious and unconscious processing of the same stimulus, either in a direct comparison of subliminal versus supraliminal stimulation, or including subliminal versus - and supraliminal versus neutral contrasts using the same stimulus within the same study. Our meta-analysis lends support to some current theories about the neural correlates of consciousness, and also has the potential to progress our understanding of psychological processes, by providing a priori brain regions involved in the delineation of automatic non-conscious states from conscious experience. Next, we discuss these findings in relation to the different levels of perceptual awareness, and theories of consciousness. \n\n### Unconscious perception of stimuli \n  \nThe right fusiform gyrus, part of the middle occipital gyrus, was most consistently activated across the fMRI studies included in this review, in response to subliminally presented arousing stimuli that were not consciously perceived. This result could be driven by more studies that employed the presentation of faces in this meta-analysis, although it is nonetheless interesting to observe that non-consciously processed faces activate this region. While the fusiform gyrus is most well-known as the \u2018fusiform face area\u2019, particularly during conscious perception of faces, activation in this area may also be associated with non-verbal facial communication (Kreifelts et al.  ), which is perhaps more implicit on first glance. Furthermore, the middle occipital gyrus is associated with the decoding of affectively arousing stimuli (Dima et al.  ). It is connected with the amygdala, a brain region associated with unconscious processing (Slipp  ) and also general arousal (Costafreda et al.  ) and may be associated with the processing of bottom up stimuli to influence declarative memory. \n\nAnother area we found to be significantly activated by subliminal stimulation is the right posterior insula cortex (PIC), which is in agreement with our previous meta-analysis of fMRI studies (Brooks et al.  ). The insular cortex is traditionally linked to conscious interoceptive awareness and the perception of one\u2019s own body (Craig  ; Craig  ). However, given the insula\u2019s connectivity to subcortical and cortical regions, this brain region could also adhere to the role of \u201cdirector\u201d of somato-sensory responses from the internal mileu, which may pre-empt conscious decisions or awareness. Therefore, it is plausible that the insular cortex would be activated in response to subliminal stimuli in order to modulate a consequential conscious response to a change in somato-sensory or visceral stimulation. The data we present here suggests that a perception of perturbations in the body can occur without conscious awareness, and might be encoded as activation at the level of the primary occipital cortex (perhaps via connections to the amygdala) and the insular cortex. \n\n\n### Anterior cingulate cortex: a gateway between pre-attentive bottom-up and top-down cognitive evaluation? \n  \nActivation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was observed across studies in response to both subliminal and supraliminal arousing stimuli in this review. This brain area is considered crucial in the detection of error following a false mental prediction and in the detection of internal conflict, such as dissonance between two competing goals, but it is unclear whether this is associated with conscious perception of the stimulation or not (Charles et al.  ). Some evidence suggests that the greater the conscious processing exerted, the higher the activation that is observed in the ACC (Mulert et al.  ). Additionally, the insular cortex and ACC have strong connections that elaborate on emotional feelings and play a role in sensory perception and conscious evaluation (Critchley  ). The IC-ACC network has also been linked to conscious self-recognition (Devue et al.  ) and is implicated in conscious executive processes (De Pisapia et al.  ). Prediction error detection is largely associated with activation of the ACC and this is also in line with contemporary views of emotion and the experience of   presence  , purporting that an emotional sense of self is not simply derived from sensing interoceptive signals, but also determined by prediction error processing, or how our belief systems match reality (Seth et al.  ). This lends support to the view that the ACC functions as a gateway between automatic primary process affective states and higher order cognitive processing, particularly when affect and cognition are in conflict, or in psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (Botvinick et al.  ; Cohen et al.  ). A conflict may also occur in the absence of awareness, when the body\u2019s physiology is unexpected perturbed, as shown for example in this meta-analysis, where some of the included studies used stimuli that altered the physiological state of the body without conscious awareness. However, the different types of stimulation included in this review may have confounded our findings, and so caution must be taken with interpretation. Furthermore, despite the original stimulus being unconsciously perceived, subsequent bodily reflexes, such as heart rate variability, tactile stimulation, perspiration, muscle tension are likely to be consciously perceived (e.g. the basis of a gut feeling). In a recent study, the presentation of subliminal sexual images was linked to ACC activation and potential cognitive conflict in men, as sexual affective states were engaged in the brain, but not indulged, which likely led to a conscious perception of frustration (Gillath & Canterberry  ). Furthermore, others show that there is a dynamic relationship between bottom-up primary sensory activations and top-down modulation by the ACC (Crottaz-Herbette & Menon  ), formulating an eventual global, or \u2018bigger picture\u2019 perspective. It is likely that affect processing, whether at first consciously perceived or not, alters prefrontal cortical systems via the ACC. Translating this in relation to the stimuli used in the fMRI studies presented here, one might argue that stimulation of the rectum and emotional faces (the most commonly used stimuli in the studies included in this review) all evoke arousal states deep in the brain that perturb pre-attentive neural circuits. The level of ACC involvement in this process, subsequent interoceptive awareness and cognitive evaluation of bodily state in response to an affective stimulus, is likely to be biased by previous experience in line with current self-referential goals and contextual cues. \n\n\n### Linking our findings to theories of consciousness \n  \nOur data were not able to provide direct support for Damasio\u2019s Somatic Marker Hypothesis, which implicates the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex and periaqueductal gray in the influence of non-conscious processes on conscious decision making (Damasio  ; Damasio  ). However, the studies presented here did not measure decision making processes. Some contemporary theories of consciousness purport that the experience of 'qualia' or the subjective awareness of one's self perceiving (e.g. what is it like to experience the colour red?), is achieved by attention mechanisms in prefrontal cortical systems, such as the ACC, being directed from 'backstage' signals that are represented by distinct neural signatures in the mesolimbic brain regions, such as the striatum (Baars & Franklin  ) and primary visual areas for mental imagery. Baars, in his Global Workspace Theory (GWT) proposes the view that unconscious processes, such as those derived from subliminal visual stimuli, interact with cognitive processes in the PFC, such as working memory, to cognitively frame a consciously-perceived self-relevant goal (Baars & Franklin  ), which may also be referred to as a \u2018cognitive bias\u2019. Others support Baars\u2019 global workspace theory, implicating the ACC and areas that connect to this region (e.g. insula cortex, visual cortex, mesolimbic regions), enabling consciousness to be directed by a vast network of backstage processes supporting neural functions that are not consciously perceived, (Dehaene et al.  ) . Thus, although our meta-analysis highlights brain regions involved in non-conscious sensory (as opposed to cognitive) processing, it could be that activation of the ACC, visual cortex and insula by non-consciously perceived stimuli could further influence downstream prefrontal cortex systems (via the ACC as a gateway to other PFC systems) associated with higher-order cognitions (e.g. working memory). \n\nOther contemporary theories of consciousness focus on how non-conscious processing can influence behavior and prime responses to stimuli (Eimer & Schlaghecken  ). It has been shown that masked, and thus non-consciously perceived stimuli can alter preferences and speed of choice, which may for example, be the basis of impulsive responses. Response facilitation and inhibition in subliminal priming is suggested to involve fronto-striatal circuits (Eimer & Schlaghecken  ) and could be a key to understanding triggers for impulsive behaviours in some psychiatric disorders (e.g. addiction, aggression, eating disorders). \n\nHowever, our data did not implicate fronto-striatal circuitry (only ACC) in unconscious processing, but instead found that non-consciously processed stimuli activate visual cortex, insula and ACC. Against the background of the current data, must proceed with caution when choosing subliminal paradigms to test theories of unconscious perception, given our current lack of knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms of subliminal stimulation. For example, it is not currently known to what extent the semantic context of masked stimuli is processed at an unconscious level, and whether subliminal stimulation activates processes that linger in the brain for secondary higher-order conscious processing. Given these limitations to our current knowledge, subliminal paradigms may not be the best choice for collecting data on unconscious processes. Nevertheless, subliminal paradigms may be valuable for probing arousal mechanisms in the brain that are independent of cognitive modulation (Brooks & Stein  ) especially if a direct comparison of subliminal versus supraliminal effects on the brain using the same stimulus is conducted. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nWe found 9 studies reporting the neural correlates of subliminal activation, and 10 studies reporting the neural correlates of supraliminal activation. Given that our sample size was small, our data must be regarded as preliminary, providing basic insights into the neural correlates of conscious processing that need further clarification with additional brain imaging studies. Additionally, the studies included were heterogeneous with a bias towards stimulation with images of faces and rectal stimulation, which likely drove the findings we obtained. Related to the heterogeneity of studies, we also included both studies that provided a direct comparison between subliminal and supraliminal stimulation, as well as studies that compared subliminal and supraliminal stimulation separately to a neutral condition. We did this so that we could include all studies that examined the same subliminal and supraliminal stimulus in their publication, even if they did not directly compare these levels of stimulation. Also, it must be noted that although the participants in this meta-analysis were psychologically healthy, a small number of participants had existing medical conditions (e.g. GERD, IBS), which may have influenced brain function. Furthermore, the ALE approach we adopted does not take into account the relative strength of activation reported by each study, but the present version is essentially a 'vote-counting' method of reported coordinates weighted for the number of participants per study. There were not enough studies examining separately neural activation in males and females, which, as one of the studies has shown (Gillath & Canterberry  ), may be important in terms of gauging different levels of cognitive control exerted over arousing stimuli. Furthermore, the stimuli, although commonly activating bodily sensations, were quite diverse, incorporating auditory tones, somatosensory and visual stimulation, and there were not enough studies using one particular modality to conduct separate meta-analyses. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWhile our data is preliminary, it suggests that perception of non-consciously perceived stimuli activates anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insular cortex, to form a basis for conscious perception. Activation of primary visual areas by non-consciously perceived stimuli is perhaps driven by a bias for these studies to use images of emotional faces, and so more fMRI studies are needed to compare subliminal and supraliminal presentation of other types of stimuli in different modalities. After further fMRI studies comparing the neural correlates of subliminal versus supraliminal stimulation, meaningful conclusions are more likely to be drawn about brain systems involved in unconscious perception. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4271330, "text_md5": "63e862198d0bbe6a6047ad5fa09ba192", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 97], "journal": [98, 109], "publication_year": [111, 115], "title": [126, 279], "keywords": [293, 416], "abstract": [429, 2390], "body": [2399, 35836]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 25593703, "doi": "10.1186/s40359-014-0052-1", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4271330", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4271330"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4271330\">4271330</a>", "list_title": "PMC4271330  Subliminal versus supraliminal stimuli activate neural responses in anterior cingulate cortex, fusiform gyrus and insula: a meta-analysis of fMRI studies"}

A handful of meta\u2010analyses have attempted to synthesise findings on neural mechanisms of divergent thinking. With the rapid proliferation of research and recent developments in fMRI meta\u2010analysis approaches, it is timely to reassess the regions activated during divergent thinking creativity tasks. Of particular interest is examining the evidence regarding large\u2010scale brain networks proposed to be key in divergent thinking and extending this work to consider the role of the semantic control network. Studies utilising fMRI with healthy participants completing divergent thinking tasks were systematically identified, with 20 studies meeting the criteria. Activation Likelihood Estimation was then used to integrate the neuroimaging results across studies. This revealed four clusters: the left inferior parietal lobe; the left inferior frontal and precentral gyrus; the superior and medial frontal gyrus and the right cerebellum. These regions are key in the semantic network, important for flexible retrieval of stored knowledge, highlighting the role of this network in divergent thinking. \n  \nA meta\u2010analysis of fMRI studies into divergent thinking, with a comparison to default mode, multiple demand and semantic control networks. This found four clusters; the left inferior parietal lobe; the left inferior frontal and precentral gyrus; the superior and medial frontal gyrus and the right cerebellum. The largest overlap is with the semantic control network, highlighting the role of this network in divergent thinking.   \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nCreativity is the result of a complex interaction between cognitive functioning, ability, personality, affect and motivation (Abraham, Rutter, Bantin, & Hermann,  ). It is the foundation of our ability to progress; allowing us to interact appropriately with our ever\u2010changing environment. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that support creativity is of great interest. Definitions typically suggest that creativity requires the combination of   originality   (novel and unique; Runco & Jaeger,  ) and   usefulness   (appropriate and meaningful; Runco & Jaeger,  ), with some authors arguing for a third required element of   surprise   (Acar, Burnett, & Cabra,  ; Boden,  ; Simonton,  ; Sternberg & Kaufman,  ). Since Guilford's ( ) APA presidential address, \u2018divergent thinking\u2019 has been considered a key component of creativity (Onarheim & Friis\u2010Olivarius,  ). It refers to the generation of many possible ideas for a particular problem. For example, in the Alternative Uses Task (AUT; Benedek, et al.,  ; Fink et al.,  ; Guilford, Christensen, Merrifield, & Wilson,  ; Jung et al.,  ), one of the most commonly used divergent thinking task (DTTs), participants are instructed to generate as many alternative uses of conventional objects as they can (e.g., \u2018name as many alternative uses for a BRICK as possible\u2019). Tasks such as these, and other measures of creative thinking, have been widely used in conjunction with neuroimaging in recent years in an attempt to understand the neural bases of creative thinking. A great deal of initial work focused on the involvement of specific regions of the brain or on the neural time course of creative thinking (see reviews by Arden, Chavez, Grazioplene, & Jung,  ; Dietrich & Kanso,  ), however, it is also of interest to explore interactions of divergent thinking with large scale brain networks over time which few studies have sought to do (see Beaty, Benedek, Silvia, & Schacter,  ). \n\nWork on the brain regions involved in divergent thinking has tended to focus on three broad regions: the pre\u2010frontal, parietal and temporal cortices. These areas, as described below, are part of broader large\u2010scale brain networks which work together to shape cognition, and these networks are of particular interest in this meta\u2010analysis. \n\nSeveral studies have implicated areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as being important for divergent thinking, highlighting the requirement for executive and semantic control in this process, which rely heavily on prefrontal areas. However, there is some debate about the role of this region in divergent thinking. Some researchers suggest that the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is activated in divergent thinking, retrieving and selecting relevant remote associations for the production of   original   ideas, a process requiring   flexibility   (Abraham, Pieritz, et al.,  ; Abraham et al.,  ). Past meta\u2010analyses into divergent thinking appear to confirm this, with activation of the IFG being sensitive to semantic distance or associative strength (Wu et al.,  ). Other work reports that this activity seems weak. For instance, Fink et al. ( ,  ) found that activation within the left IFG was only present when DTTs were compared to a fixation stimulus, but not when compared to control tasks. This may be because standard control tasks, such as object characterisation, also rely on the semantic control system, and so activity related to divergent thinking is not strong enough to survive the contrast. However, several studies have found an inhibitory role of the IFG (Beaty et al.,  ; Ivancovsky, Kleinmintz, Lee, Kurman, & Shamay\u2010Tsoory,  ) with Kleinmintz et al. ( ) suggesting evaluating original ideas was related to an increase in activation in the left IFG, whereas generating original ideas was related to inhibition of the left IFG.The IFG has also been said to control activation in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) said to be important in both the semantic and default mode network (DMN), with Vartanian et al. ( ) suggesting the IFG selects ideas that are generated by the MTG to produce responses consistent with the task demands. \n\nMore dorsal areas outside the realm of semantic control have also been associated with processes supporting divergent thinking. As part of a multiple demand network (MDN), areas such as the dorsolateral pre\u2010frontal cortex (DLPFC) allow the manipulation of information within working memory (Wagner, Maril, Bjork, & Schacter,  ), as well as selecting and sustaining attention needed for fluency of responses (Shah et al.,  ). Some studies report increased activity in the DLPFC during creative tasks (Sun et al.,  ) with Abraham, Pieritz, et al. ( ) proposing the role of this region in creative processes. However, in other creative tasks such as improvisation, deactivation within executive control areas of the PFC corresponds to improvisational expertise (Limb & Braun,  ; Pinho, de Manzano, Fransson, Eriksson, & Ull\u00e9n,  ), with deactivation of the DLPFC being said to contribute to increased cognitive flexibility (Nelson et al.,  ). Finally, previous studies have demonstrated anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activated in many DTTs (Abraham, Pieritz, et al.,  ; Fink et al.,  ; Howard\u2010Jones, Blakemore, Samuel, Summers, & Claxton,  ; Kleibeuker, Koolschijn, Jolles, De Dreu, & Crone,  ) including the ventral anterior as well as posterior cingulate cortex (Mayseless, Eran, & Shamay\u2010Tsoory,  ), and the both the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex has been shown to be key in the DMN (Beaty et al.,  ,  ; Heinonen et al.,  ). The dorsal ACC particularly shows significant increase activity when creativity training is given (Sun et al.,  ), and an increase in activation has been noted across various divergent tasks (Abraham, Pieritz, et al.,  ; Kleibeuker et al.,  ) with this region implicated in the MDN (Duncan,  ).This may reflect the role of ACC in conflict monitoring of prepotent but irrelevant responses (Botvinick, Cohen, & Carter,  ). In summary, from the reviewed work both activation and deactivation in the PFC have been associated with divergent thinking and creativity. \n\nThere are also a number of studies that have focused on areas in the posterior parietal cortex in idea generation. Abraham, Pieritz, et al. ( ) and Fink et al. ( ) demonstrated that the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL), including the supra\u2010marginal gyrus (SMG), was important for the originality aspect of generating creative ideas using the AUT task amongst others. Benedek et al. ( ) showed that creating new ideas was associated with increased activation of the left SMG, supporting the role of the SMG in the left anterior IPL with generation of   original   ideas. The IPL has previously been associated with the use of the DMN in divergent thinking (Heinonen et al.,  ), and has been said to play a role, alongside other parts of the DMN, in producing new combinations important for originality during the creative process (Buckner, Andrews\u2010Hanna, & Schacter,  ; Ellamil, Dobson, Beeman, & Christoff,  ) with Ivancovsky et al. ( ) findings higher creativity in the generation phase of the AUT was associated with greater activation of the IPL, This area has also been previously associated with the verbal generation of ideas, and episodic memory retrieval during generation (Bechtereva et al.,  ; Mathias Benedek, Jauk, et al.,  ). The AUT task involves manipulation of common objects to find creative uses for them, and as previously mentioned the IPL is activated in these tasks. This region, however, has also been shown to be an area important for tool manipulation (Barde, Buxbaum, & Moll,  ; Ishibashi, Ralph, Saito, & Pobric,  ) and it is therefore, possible that the IPL is activated in response to mental manipulation of objects to aid the conception of novel or alternative uses. In contrast to the aforementioned work, other studies of divergent thinking, and related creative tasks, have shown deactivation within the right posterior parietal cortex, including the precuneus, superior parietal lobe (SPL) and right IPL (Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et al.,  ; Wu et al.,  ). It is currently unclear whether these results reflect the same network, or whether there were experimental reasons for the discrepancy of results. \n\nThe left posterior temporal cortex has also been implicated in divergent thinking. The fusiform gyrus (FG) as part of the visual network has been implicated in visuospatial creativity tasks (Chen et al.,  ) as well as construction of novel images and mental imagery (Chrysikou & Thompson\u2010Schill,  ; Huang et al.,  ) with Yeh, Hsu, and Rega ( ) commenting that the left FG was activated during \u2018incubation and insight\u2019 and \u2018evaluation and decision making\u2019 along with the MTG. These regions have been shown to are both associated with object identification and naming (Martin & Chao,  ), which may be important for   fluency   in tasks such as the AUT (Abraham, Pieritz, et al.,  ; Bechtereva et al.,  ; Fink et al.,  ,  ). The middle temporal cortex (MTC) has been shown to be influenced by top\u2010down feedback from the PFC, which has strong links to DTT's and therefore this may link the middle temporal cortex to the generation of new ideas needed for   originality   (Wu et al.,  ). The posterior middle temporal cortex forms part of a semantic control network, alongside the PFC and dorsal angular gyrus (Noonan, Jefferies, Visser, & Lambon Ralph,  ). Therefore, it may be important in bringing together remotely associated items, whilst inhibiting more dominant relationships. \n\nWhat is clear from the above section is that a number of disparate brain regions respond to DTTs, and these areas are part of a broader network across the brain. There has been discussion in the literature as to the respective roles in divergent thinking and creativity of (a) bottom\u2010up thinking, allowing spontaneous and free\u2010flowing ideas, shown in the deactivation of key executive regions or response of areas classically defined as part of the \u2018default mode\u2019 network (Yeo et al.,  ) and (b) top\u2010down control to inhibit dominant responses and guide behaviour to be task appropriate, shown through activation of areas considered part of the MDN (Duncan,  ), or executive control networks (Seeley et al.,  ) such as the dorsolateral frontal and parietal cortices. \n\nThe DMN is a distributed network of regions more active during rest, than during performance of attention demanding tasks, and is functionally defined by decreased activation during these tasks (Buckner et al.,  ). The four core regions identified in the DMN are the medial PFC, posterior cingulate cortex, and both the left and right IPL. Additionally the MTG is implicated as part of the DMN (Roger E Beaty et al.,  ; Buckner et al.,  ; Yeo et al.,  ). On the other hand, the MDN involves coordinated activity of a largescale network when taking part in goal\u2010directed effortful behaviour. This is known to activate regions such as the DLPFC, inferior frontal junction, and then dorsal and ACC (Crittenden, Mitchell, & Duncan,  ; Duncan & Owen,  ; Fedorenko, Duncan, & Kanwisher,  ). Past research also points to the role of brain regions associated with cognitive control, known as the executive control network. This is engaged in tasks that require externally directed attention including the DLPFC, and anterior IPL (Beaty et al.,  ; Seeley et al.,  ), and these regions have been implicated in past meta\u2010analyses in divergent thinking (Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et al.,  ). The executive and DMN have been shown to cooperate in several processes involving top\u2010down modulation of information (Andrews\u2010Hanna, Smallwood, & Spreng,  ). \n\nThese networks are well defined in literature, and there is agreement over network masks that are commonly used within neuroimaging research into these networks. (Yeo et al.,  ) produced seven cortical networks specified cortical parcellation using resting state functional, as well as a 17 network parcellation that split these networks into sub\u2010networks connectivity that identified the default mode and executive network. The MDN mask was taken from Duncan ( ) who produced this mask utilising previous reviews (Duncan & Owen,  ) and these masks are regularly used throughout creativity literature (Beaty, Benedek, Kaufman, & Silvia,  ; Evans, Krieger\u2010Redwood, Gonzalez Alam, Smallwood, & Jefferies,  ; Lu et al.,  ; Mok,  ) Recent work has begun to explore the interactions of these networks when performing DTTs and thinking creatively. In a review of this work, Beaty et al. ( ) propose that whereas the default mode and executive control networks normally act in opposition to each other, when thinking creatively a pattern of co\u2010operative activation emerges over time, with the salience network acting to co\u2010ordinate this coupling (see also Beaty et al.,  ). Given, the suggested importance of these networks for divergent thinking, the present meta\u2010analysis will compare overlap of the DMN and MDN, as well as the executive control network which has been included in an extended MDN (Camilleri et al.,  ), to areas activated in our meta\u2010analysis in order to make comparisons as to regions of similarity. \n\nOf further interest is that between these networks sits a third, the semantic control network (Jefferies & Lambon Ralph,  ) as defined in a mask (Noonan et al.,  ). This arguably is likely to play the greatest role in flexible thought (Jefferies,  ). Semantic control may be important for divergent thinking because as a system it allows us to guide retrieval by inhibiting dominant associations and retrieving weaker relationships in a non\u2010automatic fashion (Lambon Ralph et al.,  ). Control is required when we: (a) retrieve weakly associated items, such as linking   and   (Noonan, Jefferies, Corbett, & Lambon Ralph,  ), (b) inhibit strong distractors, such as selecting   goes with   when   is present (Noonan et al.,  ), (c) understand ambiguous words within the current context, such as   at a riverside (Rodd et al.,  ), and (d) provide internally guided constraint when multiple potential responses are possible, such as during picture naming (e.g., Jefferies et al.,  ) or object use (Corbett, Jefferies, & Ralph,  ). Regions implicated in semantic control have also been shown to be important in divergent thinking. The IFG within the ventral PFC is said to be critical for the selection of task\u2010relevant attributes (Stampacchia et al.,  ) as well as being important in the selection of distant associated in divergent thinking (Abraham et al.,  ). Vartanian et al. ( ) suggested that IFG selects these ideas that have been generated through activation in the MTG, which has also been shown to be needed for flexible processing of concepts in semantic activation (Hoffman, Pobric, Drakesmith, & Lambon Ralph,  ; Whitney, Kirk, O'Sullivan, Lambon Ralph, & Jefferies,  ). Interestingly, whilst the importance of semantic processing for divergent thinking has been a subject of continued interest (Beaty et al.,  ) and methods to analyse semantic relatedness of ideas produced in DTTs have been developed (Kenett,  ), consideration of the role of the semantic control network has been largely separate from the neuroscience of creativity and divergent thinking literature. It has recently been argued that the semantic memory system may play an important role in creative thinking., largely due to the similarity of regions activated in these tasks and importance in the semantic control network (Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et al.,  ; Wu et al.,  ), however little research comments on the role of the semantic control network despite the overlap in regions known to be key in both this network and divergent thinking. Here we systematically synthesise and explore how much the neural mechanisms of semantic control overlap with those found to be involved in DTTs. We predict there will be extensive overlap between semantic control regions and areas which are found to be important for divergent thinking, such as left inferior frontal gyrus, posterior temporal and parietal regions. Although the semantic network, and the networks discuss above are functionally distinct, there may be overlap in regions that couple with other networks depending on the context. \n\nA handful of meta\u2010analyses exist that have sought to summarise neural activity in creative tasks (Boccia, Piccardi, Palermo, Nori, & Palmiero,  ; Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et al.,  ; Wu et al.,  ). Dietrich and Kanso ( ) firstly conducted a review of divergent thinking across EEG, ERP, and neuroimaging studies, finding highly variegated results, but changes in the ACC and prefrontal areas. Future studies sought to build upon this, with Boccia et al. ( ) examined domain specific creativity and found regions in the parietal frontal and temporal lobes were activated depending on the different domain: musical creativity activated MFG, left cingulate gyrus and IPL, whereas verbal creativity activated mainly the left hemisphere regions such as the PFC, middle and superior temporal gyrus and right IPL. Gonen\u2010Yaacovi et al. ( ) looked at creative tasks more generally and similarly found the lateral PFC, IPL and posterior temporal cortices were active. However, to our knowledge only one meta\u2010analysis specifically examining divergent thinking uses activation likelihood estimation technique (ALE; Wu et al.,  ). The ALE is a foci\u2010based technique, which treats foci as spatial probability distributions centred at coordinates rather than points, and seeks to estimate the likelihood of activations across multiple studies (Eickhoff, Bzdok, Laird, Kurth, & Fox,  ; Laird et al.,  ; Turkeltaub, Eden, Jones, & Zeffiro,  ). Wu et al. ( ) found regions important in divergent thinking could be split into the semantic and cognitive control systems, based on regions activated in their ALE, and therefore any replication should find similar results. Since the publication of Wu et al. ( ), the use of fMRI in creativity research has vastly increased with similar amounts published in the last 5\u2009years compared to the 50\u2009years before that. There has also been the creation of best practice guidelines for meta\u2010analyses, which aim to improve transparency, traceability, replicability and reporting (M\u00fcller et al.,  ). We therefore strongly believe an up to\u2010date meta\u2010analysis replicating Wu et al. ( ) but following the best practice guidelines is essential to provide a current consensus regarding the fMRI literature on divergent thinking. This will enable us to synthesise the disparate findings about the brain regions that are important, and more importantly discuss these regions within the context of existing networks, to explore an integration between work on the neural mechanisms of divergent thinking and those for semantic control \n\n\n## METHOD \n  \n### Selection of studies \n  \nA systematic search was used to identify all literature in which healthy participants completed a DTT recorded by fMRI (Figure  ). An initial search was carried out on 19th March 2019 with the aid of PubMED, Scopus, PLOS, Web of Science, PsychINFO, ScienceDirect and EMBase databases using the following keywords in their title or abstract: creativ* AND (divergent AND thinking) AND (fMRI OR functional magnetic resonance imaging). This yielded 261 results across all databases, which were screened for inclusion in the meta\u2010analysis. These searches were re\u2010run in September 2019 to identify any new research meeting the criteria that had been published. \n  \nModified PRISMA flow diagram showing the procedure followed for the meta\u2010analysis selection process. In all databases the title, abstract and keywords of the publication records were searched. All identified meta\u2010analyses reporting divergent thinking tasks using fMRI were screened. During assessment for eligibility all abstracts were checked for: (a) new data, (b) fMRI rather than other imaging methods, (c) results reported in full, (d) task was an established divergent task rather than novel experimental paradigm, (e) coordinates reported for contrasts needed \n  \nInclusion criteria were as follows: (a) all subjects in the study were healthy adults, (b) all tasks tested divergent thinking in an experimental paradigm that also included control tasks, (c) all coordinates were reported in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space and (d) all reported activation coordinates were based on the entire brain. \n\nAfter removing duplicates, 127 studies remained, which were reduced through screening by title to 62 studies. At this stage, further studies were searched for in reference lists of studies that passed screening, as well as previous meta\u2010analyses of fMRI studies of divergent thinking, however none were identified. Following this, two of the authors independently reviewed all study abstracts to select those that met the inclusion criteria. During this process, where contrast coordinates were identified as missing, authors were contacted a maximum of two times before a study was excluded. A total of 19 published fMRI studies passed all requirements and were taken forward to the ALE stage (Table  ), double the amount available in the previous meta\u2010analysis by Wu et al. ( ). \n  \nfMRI studies for both divergent\u2009>\u2009control and control\u2009>\u2009divergent contrasts, and their regions of interest (CROI) selected in ALE meta\u2010analysis of divergent thinking   DTT\u2009>\u2009CT  \n    \n\n### Tasks \n  \n#### Alternative uses task \n  \nThe alternative uses task (AUT) task (Guilford et al.,  ), as previously described, is a widely used and well validated measure of divergent thinking (Benedek, et al.,  ; Fink et al.,  ; Jung et al.,  ; K\u00fchn et al.,  ). Fluency, flexibility and originality are all measured. This task is commonly applied alongside control tasks, such as the object characteristics task, in which participants are instructed to generate features for the object presented, or object uses task where participants are instructed to name the use of the object presented (K\u00fchn et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Creative visualisation task \n  \nIn this task, participants are asked to mentally manipulate three shapes to create a novel object (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et al.,  ). This task is often administered alongside a visuospatial control task such as the mental rotation task, where participants rotate an object to make a shape. Although involving visual processing, this task is divergent in nature as it requires novel responses, and is similar to AUT as it requires mental rotation of shapes, rather than an object, to produce something novel, with results being given verbally (Aziz\u2010Zadeh et al.,  ). \n\n\n#### Verb generation task \n  \nThis task is similar to the AUT in that it requires a creative response to a stimulus, however here, stimuli presented are a series of nouns, and participants are asked to generate a novel verb related to the noun shown (Beaty, Christensen, Benedek, Silvia, & Schacter,  ). Verb generation tasks have been shown to be a valid assessment of creative thought, as demonstrated by Prabhakaran, Green, and Gray ( ). They are often paired with a recall condition as the control task, where participants must recall previously studied noun\u2010verb pairs, which requires a convergent response. \n\n\n#### Novel metaphor task \n  \nIn this task participants are required to create a metaphor that compares a topic to an unrelated object. (Benedek, et al.,  ) suggested that metaphor generation requires the formation of an abstract connection between two concepts, linking a conceptual category to a spontaneously generated other topic whilst ignoring relevant concepts. This open\u2010ended task therefore relies on similar cognitive processes to other divergent tasks. This task has been paired with a literal expression condition that matches the underlying processes but does not require divergent thinking (Beaty et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n### Activation likelihood estimation technique \n  \nALE is a method utilised to integrate neuroimaging results from across studies (Laird et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ) and has been used in previous meta\u2010analyses (Pidgeon et al.,  ; Wu et al.,  ). ALE models uncertainty in the localisation of activation foci, using Gaussian probability density distributions through modelling the probability distribution centred at the coordinates of each foci (Eickhoff et al.,  ). The size of the full\u2010width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian kernel is determined by an ALE algorithm, which accommodates larger samples sizes and therefore provides a more certain estimation of spatial locations. Probability distributions are combined into modelled activation maps, and activation probabilities, or ALE scores, which are calculated based on the union of maps across studies. ALE values are tested under the null distribution of spatial independence (Fitzgerald, Laird, Maller, & Daskalakis,  ; Sabatinelli et al.,  ). \n\n\n###  ALE   analysis \n  \nThis meta\u2010analysis was conducted using the revised approach from Eickhoff et al. ( ) following the latest recommendations for ALE meta\u2010analyses (M\u00fcller et al.,  ) using GingerALE 3.0.2. Software ( ). Coordinates of the foci were taken from the original papers or from the experimenters directly providing the data. A total of 162 foci were reported in 19 experiments involving 596 participants. \n\nIn the ALE analysis of single datasets, regions of interest (ROIs) of fMRI studies on divergent tasks versus control tasks (127 foci reported in 19 experiments; Table  ) and control versus divergent tasks (35 foci reported in eight experiments; Table  ) were inserted separately. We also planned separate ALE analyses to assess the effect of different divergent tasks on the brain activity associated with divergent thinking, however only the AUT had enough studies to perform this and as there was no change in the overall pattern of results, the analysis will focus on all divergent tasks combined. Analyses were also were performed on studies requiring only one response (SR) versus multiple responses (MR) per trial (SR versus MR; 106 foci in 20 experiments) however this yielded no significant differences. \n\nThe ALE was run using MNI coordinates (peaks reported in Talairach space were converted to MNI using tal2icbm_spm transportation with GingerALE; Lancaster et al.,  ) according to the procedure proposed by Eickhoff et al. ( ). ALE maps were calculated using 5,000 permutations and a cluster level FWE of   p  \u2009<\u2009.05 with a cluster forming voxel level threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 based upon the latest recommendations from M\u00fcller et al. ( ). Only clusters with dimensions exceeding the recommended size were reported. Each ALE map was visualised using Mango ( ) and Anatomist ( ), and was overlaid on the anatomical MNI Colin27 template for visual inspection and representation purposes. \n\nFollowing the initial analysis with a cluster forming voxel level threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.001, a follow\u2010up analysis was run using a cluster forming voxel level threshold of   p  \u2009<\u2009.01, which matches the threshold level of the previous meta\u2010analyses as well as the fMRI studies themselves. \n\n\n### Overlap analysis \n  \nWe also compared the overlap of the ALE to pre\u2010existing brain networks, as we were particularly interested in whether these regions activated in divergent thinking overlapped with the networks, and to what extent. Network maps used were taken from existing and well established masks: default mode and executive control network from Yeo et al. ( ), MDN from Duncan ( ) and semantic control network from Noonan et al. ( ). Overlap was primarily a visual inspection of the resulting overlap maps. However, we also used the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC; Dice,  ) a validation metric of spatial overlap between two segmentations. When there is no overlap DSC = 0 and complete overlap DSC = 1. Although we are not expecting to see a complete overlap, when DSC\u2009>\u20090 it shows evidence that regions activated in DTTs overlap with pre\u2010existing large\u2010scale networks. \n\n\n### Open access and declarations \n  \nThe procedure followed for the meta\u2010analysis can be found in the Open Science Framework (OSF;  ). Digital materials and data where possible are also available in the OSF ( ) including full reporting of any analyses not reported. Any digit materials or data that are inaccessible due to the programme used can be released by contacting the corresponding author. The study was registered on OSF prior to beginning the systematic search and all manipulation and measure of this study are reported in the following sections. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \nNineteen fMRI publications of divergent thinking, with an average sample size of 24.79 and a mean sample age of 28.59 were included in the present ALE analysis. Of these 190, eight included control\u2009>\u2009divergent contrasts. \n\n###  ALE   results of activated regions at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 \n  \n#### DTT\u2009>\u2009CT \n  \nTable   and Figure   show the ALE results of fMRI studies of DTTs. Two clusters in the left hemisphere were more active under divergent tasks compared to control tasks. The peak ALE value of the first cluster was located in the left parietal lobe, with 50% in the post central gyrus, and 50% in the left IPL (BA 40; BA 2) [cluster coordinates are from (\u221264, \u221234, 28) to (\u221252, \u221218, 46) centred at (\u221258.8, \u221227.6, 37), with one peak with an ALE value of .021]. The second cluster peak ALE value was located in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG; BA 6) [cluster coordinates are from (\u22126, 12, 48) to (2, 24, 60) centred at (\u22122.8, 18.5, 54.5) with one peak with an ALE value of .024]. No clusters that met the ALE threshold were located in the right hemisphere. \n  \nALE results for thresholding at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001 \n    \nPeak ALE cluster locations for divergent thinking tasks\u2009>\u2009control tasks, activated at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. Shown in neurological view, Cluster 1, labelled as such, is centred in the left parietal lobe (BA 40 and 6) and is 1,552\u2009mm  and Cluster 2 is centred in the left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6) and is 904\u2009mm \n  \n\n####  CT  \u2009>\u2009  DTTs  \n  \nFor control tasks versus divergent tasks, no clusters met the threshold level. This is likely due to there being only eight experiments that report activation foci for the contrast in this direction. \n\n\n\n###  ALE   results of activated regions at   p  \u2009<\u2009.01 \n  \n#### DTT\u2009>\u2009CT \n  \nTable   and Figure   show the ALE results of fMRI studies in DTTs at the less conservative threshold level of   p  \u2009<\u2009.01. Four clusters were shown to be more active under divergent tasks than control tasks. The peak ALE value of the first cluster was located in the left IFG (BA 46) [cluster coordinates are from (\u221254, 6, \u22128) to (\u221242, 36, 18) centred at (\u221248.6, 21, 8.2) with five peaks with an overall ALE value of .012 which was not shown at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. The ALE value of the second cluster was located in the left IPL (BA 40) [cluster coordinates are from (\u221264, \u221234, 26) to (\u221250, \u221218, 46) centred at (\u221257.6, \u221226.6, 36.8) with two peaks with an ALE value of .021, mirroring the cluster 1 at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. The third cluster peak ALE value was located in the left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6) [cluster coordinates are from (\u22128, 8, 40) to (2, 30, 60) centred at (\u22123.2, 19.1, 53.3) with two peaks with an ALE value of .024 and again mirroring Cluster 2 from the ALE at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. Finally, the fourth cluster with peak ALE value was located in the right hemisphere, in the right posterior cerebellum [cluster coordinates are from (16, \u221284, \u221236) to (6, \u221268, \u221222) centred at (24.7, \u221277.2, 30.7) with three peaks with an ALE value of .012] which was not shown at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001. \n  \nALE results for thresholding at   p  \u2009<\u2009.01 \n    \nPeak ALE cluster locations for divergent thinking tasks\u2009>\u2009control tasks activated at   p  \u2009<\u2009.01. Shown in neurological view, Cluster 1, labelled as such, is centred in the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 46) and is 1,904\u2009mm  in size, Cluster 2 is centred in the left inferior parietal lobe (BA 40) and is 2,288\u2009mm  in size and Cluster 3 is centred in the left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6) and is 1,944\u2009mm . Cluster 4 is centred in the right posterior cerebellum and is 1,600\u2009mm  in size \n  \n\n#### CT\u2009>\u2009DTT \n  \nSimilarly to the results at   p  \u2009<\u2009.001, no clusters met the threshold level for the contrast control versus divergent tasks. \n\n\n\n### Cluster 1: The role of   IFG   in divergent thinking \n  \nWhen the divergent ALE mask was compared to a semantic control network (Noonan et al.,  , Figure  ) we can see a number of areas of overlap, most notably with the IFG in Cluster 1. When comparing the ALE to the MDN (Duncan,  ; Figure  ) the IFG also overlapped with this network. There was also overlap with both the executive control network and DMN (Yeo et al.,   Figures   and  ), emphasising the importance of both these networks as suggested in Beaty et al. ( ). This suggests that the DLPFC, which sits within the middle frontal gyrus in BA46, is a key area within cluster 1. \n  \nNeurological view of overlap of divergent ALE (blue) and semantic control system ALE from Noonan et al.,   (yellow) showing high Cluster 1 overlap (left IFG) and high Cluster 3 overlap (left SFG/MFG) \n    \nNeurological view of overlap of divergent ALE (blue) and multiple demand network from Duncan,   (green) showing partial Cluster 1 overlap (left IFG) and high Cluster 3 overlap (left SFG/MFG) \n    \nNeurological view of overlap of divergent ALE (blue) and executive control network from Yeo et al.,   (cyan) showing partial cluster 1 overlap (left IFG) and high cluster 3 overlap (left SFG/MFG) \n    \nNeurological view of overlap of divergent ALE (blue) and default mode network from Yeo et al.,   (red) showing a small amount of Cluster 1 overlap (left IFG) and no overlap in Clusters 2 or 3 \n  \n\n### Cluster 2: The role of   IPL   in divergent thinking \n  \nWe also compared Cluster 2 to the semantic control (Noonan et al.,  ; Figure  ), multiple demand (Duncan,  ; Figure  ) and the executive and default mode (Yeo et al.,  ; Figures   and  ) networks. There was no overlap in any of the existing networks with the left IPL, and because of this we chose to compare this cluster to a mask for \u2018tools\u2019 as the IPL has been shown to be important in tool manipulation (Ishibashi et al.,  ), and the AUT involves processes similar to this. The \u2018tool\u2019 mask was created from the synthesis of 115 studies using Neurosynth software ( ; Figure  ), and we found a high level of overlap. \n  \nNeurological view of overlap of ALE (blue), and tools (pink) automated meta\u2010analysis of 115 studies produced using neurosyth ( ). Figures are labelled corresponding to clusters shown, with overlap in Cluster 1 (left IFG), Clutser 2 (left IPL) and Cluster 3 (left SFG/MFG) \n  \n\n### Cluster 3: The role of   SFG  /  MFG   in divergent thinking \n  \nWhen examining Cluster 3, we can see there appears to be overlap of the left superior and medial frontal gyrus with the semantic control system (Noonan et al.,  ; Figure  ).. We also observed overlap with the MDN, (Duncan,  ; Figure  ), in which the left IFG and left MFG are closely linked. There was also an overlap with the executive control network (Figure  ) which may reflect activity in the DLPFC which sits in the middle frontal gyrus, and is key in BA 8 where Cluster 3 sits. There was no overlap with the DMN. \n\n\n### Cluster 4: The role of the cerebellum in divergent thinking \n  \nOnly the semantic control system (Noonan et al.,  ) and MDN, (Duncan,  ) showed any activation in the right cerebellum, however neither overlapped with cluster four. \n\n#### Dice similarity coefficient of   ALE   versus pre\u2010existing networks \n  \nWhen we compared the ALE clusters to pre\u2010existing networks, the largest overlap was with the semantic control network (DSC = 0.11). We also found similar overlap with the ALE and the tool meta\u2010analysis overlay (DSC = 0.09). The executive control and multiple demand both showed similar levels of overlap (DSC = 0.02) and the DMN showed the least overlap (DSC = 0.01). \n\n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nIn this study, an ALE meta\u2010analysis was conducted to explore the brain regions involved in divergent thinking. ALE results of 19 studies showed that the left IPL (BA 40) and left superior frontal gyrus (BA 6) were involved in creative idea generation in divergent thinking, with less stringent thresholding also implicating the left precentral, inferior and medial frontal gyrus (BA 44, 45/46 & 8). The putative roles of these regions for divergent thinking are discussed below. \n\n### Cluster 1\u2014Left inferior and precentral frontal gyri (BA 45, 46, 47) \n  \nOur results indicate that the frontal cortex, more specifically the IFG were more active in DTTs. It is interesting that, despite often quite semantically demanding control tasks, these regions still appear to play a significantly greater role in divergent thought. Areas within the lateral PFC, such as the IFG, have been shown to be sensitive to the influence of the strength of the association between concepts (e.g., Noonan et al.,  ), allowing for the retrieval and selection of relevant associations to enable elaboration of concepts into novel ideas (Abraham, Pieritz, et al.,  ; Benedek, et al.,  ). The left IFG has a fundamental role in the semantic control network, which is widely replicated (cf, Noonan et al.,  ), and the overlap likely reflects the requirement to flexibly select weak and alternative associations between concepts whilst inhibiting the most dominant relationships needed for originality and fluency required for DTTs. This region also overlapped with the MDN; divergent tasks require constant attention towards the goal of the task, whilst supressing irrelevant or non\u2010creative ideas in order to increase fluency, and therefore the MDN may play a role in inhibition of this information and maintaining attention. These results suggest that the IFG assists in creative thought generation through retrieving loosely related semantic concepts and selecting creative ideas. Additionally, more dorsal prefrontal regions were found to be involved in divergent thinking. These regions, along with other more dorsal regions such as the DLPFC which sits within the middle frontal gyrus, were found to be significantly associated with divergent thought, and play a role in the MDN (Duncan,  ) and the executive control network, where we also found overlap (Yeo et al.,  ). These areas are likely to play a role in completing the task by maintaining the task requirements through working memory, attention and inhibition (Abraham, Pieritz, et al.,  ; Fink et al.,  ; Kleibeuker et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Cluster 2\u2014Left Inferior parietal lobe (  BA   40) \n  \nThe ALE results showed that the left IPL was more active under DTTs than control tasks, particularly in the AUT, which is consistent with the findings from (Wu et al.,  ). The left parietal region in BA 40 has been associated with actions and tool manipulation (Matheson, Buxbaum, & Thompson\u2010Schill,  ; Matheson & Kenett,  ). It is likely, therefore, that this reflects the role of the left IPL in the mental manipulation of objects displayed in DTTs such as the Alternative Uses paradigm, and has been cited as important in conceptual expansion (Abraham, Pieritz, et al.,  ). Connectivity between the IFG, which is required for controlled memory retrieval and response inhibition (Badre & Wagner,  ; Beaty et al.,  ), and the IPL, was found to be higher in more creative individuals. As this cluster was found to be active in AUTs specifically, we can attribute the processes associated with the IPL to be particularly important in the AUT. Therefore, our analysis adds to the mounting evidence of the role of the left IPL within the generation of novel ideas, and we speculate that activation may be related to the buffering of relevant object knowledge needed during DTTs, especially the AUT. \n\n\n### Cluster 3\u2014Left superior and medial frontal gyri (  BA   6 and 8) \n  \nThe superior and medial frontal gyri were also active in DTTs. This is likely to relate to the working memory demands involved in conceptualising and manipulating the relationship between an object and potential novel or unusual uses. Indeed, these areas of the frontal lobe have previously been associated with working memory (Abraham et al.,  ; Dietrich & Kanso,  ; Du Boisgueheneuc et al.,  ). Whilst these regions have previously been found to be highly responsive to a range of semantic tasks (e.g., Binder, Desai, Graves, & Conant,  ), they have also been found to be responsive more to high than low semantic control demands (Noonan et al.,  ), and are an integral part of the semantic control network. Nevertheless, their role extends beyond semantic tasks and appears to respond to difficult tasks which are non\u2010semantic (Duncan,  ; Duncan & Owen,  ; Vincent, Kahn, Snyder, Raichle, & Buckner,  ). It has previously been speculated, therefore, that this region is important for \u2018goal\u2010directed\u2019 or top\u2010down retrieval (Binder et al.,  ). It may be that this region allows for the maintenance of the overall task goal. The SFG has been shown to play a role in working memory and could be activated in divergent tasks due to the need for flexibility in monitoring and manipulating semantic information into ideas that show originality. This region also overlaps with the pre\u2010sensory motor area, which suggests the role of motor stimulation in divergent thinking. Matheson and Kenett ( ) discuss that whilst the motor system executes actions, simulations of this system also support other higher\u2010order cognition such as creative tasks. Specifically, divergent tasks such as the AUT are served by simulations of actions, implemented in motor regions as well as being associated with tool use as previously discussed. The DLPFC, located within the middle frontal gyrus and shown to overlap with our third cluster has been shown to be important in the semantic control network, with a role in integrating semantically distant information, and creative idea selection, needed to search in depth for higher\u2010level connections (Lucchiari, Sala, & Vanutelli,  ) as well as the executive control network where it is proposed to exert top\u2010down influence over generative processes (Beaty et al.,  ). The MFG is a key region in the MDN (Duncan,  ), and is likely to play a role, alongside the IFG, in the suppression and inhibition of ideas that are not suitable in order to remain task focused on those that have originality, providing further fluency of responses (Abraham, Beudt, et al.,  ; Fink et al.,  ; Kleibeuker et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Cluster 4\u2014Right cerebellum \n  \nThis meta\u2010analysis found activation in the right hemisphere only in the parietal cerebellum. The cerebellum was found to be activated in numerous studies (Abraham et al.,  ; Anna Abraham, Pieritz, et al.,  ; Beaty et al.,  ; Benedek, et al.,  ), however, very little discussion is given as to why this may be. The cerebellum itself has historically been implicated in motor control, however, the conception of the cerebellum has progressively evolved to that of a modulator of cognitive functions to which it is reciprocally connected (Andreasen & Pierson,  ; Marien, Engelborghs, Fabbro, & De Deyn,  ; Stoodley & Schmahmann,  ). However, it has also been said to play a role in the phonological loop function, a store that can hold verbal memory traces and a re\u2010articulation rehearsal process that refreshes memory traces (Baddeley,  ). Takeuchi et al. ( ) suggested that the language related functions of the cerebellum are important for the effective production of ideas in verbal divergent thinking, and that reciprocal connectivity to language\u2010related areas, with the posterior lobe particularly being implicated in higher order processes such as phonological, semantic and word generation (Stoodley & Schmahmann,  ). As many of the divergent tasks involved verbal responses, this may explain activation of this area. \n\n\n### Whole brain networks \n  \nOur comparison to clearly defined whole brain networks found several points of key interest. Firstly, there was the largest overlap according to DSC with the semantic control system (Noonan et al.,  ), from Clusters 1 and 3. This highlights the importance of a flexible semantic retrieval to the process of divergent thinking, requiring dampening down prepotent responses in order to actively select non\u2010dominant but task relevant information. Secondly, there was partial overlap of the multiple demand and executive networks (Duncan,  ; Yeo et al.,  ), and a small overlap with the DMN (Yeo et al.,  ). This is in line with Beaty et al.'s finding of coupling between these networks during creative processing (Beaty et al.,  ). This may reflect the importance of the default mode system in producing new combinations of concepts, important for originality (Buckner et al.,  ; Ellamil et al.,  ), while the executive system maintains top\u2010down constraint to maintain the overall task goal. \n\n\n### Comparison to previous findings \n  \nAs our meta\u2010analysis was more stringent than Wu et al. ( ), we included just four of the 10 studies in their analysis, with the remaining six being screened out. The first broke our inclusion criteria regarding the need for adults in the sample (Kleibeuker et al.,  ), two further studies focused on improving or evaluating creativity which were not the focus of this meta\u2010analysis (Fink et al.,  ; Mashal, Faust, Hendler, & Jung\u2010Beeman,  ), one did not use a control task rather comparing new versus old ideas (Benedek, et al.,  ) and the final two involved creative story generation, which was not included due to the complex other processes require to write creatively, adding too much noise to the analysis (Howard\u2010Jones et al.,  ; Shah et al.,  ). \n\nThere were some discrepancies between our results and Wu et al. ( ). This ALE found additional clusters within both the superior and medial frontal gyrus (BA 6 & 8) which were not present in Wu et al. It could be that in the present meta\u2010analysis the majority of tasks had a heavy semantic basis, and there was less variation in the tasks that met the inclusion criteria, increasing the power. These regions could also be activated in this present research due to the addition of 12 studies, which may have led to enough foci to allow these regions to show as activated, compared to only 10 in the previous study. We also did not observe areas of activation at either threshold levels within the semantic system in either the left MTG (BA 39) or the left FG (BA 37), areas said to be important in the activation of long term memories related to idea generation, nor did we observe activation in the right ACC (BA 32) which has been associated with the suppression of irrelevant thoughts (Anderson et al.,  ; Howard\u2010Jones et al.,  ). This could be due to the exclusion of creative writing tasks, and these regions could particularly be important in these due to the use of long\u2010term memories in story generation, and the ongoing need to supress irrelevant thoughts during a task that requires focus for an extended period of time. Wu et al. ( ) also described deactivation of regions in the right posterior parietal regions (IPL & SPL; BA 40 & 7) and the right MFG (BA 46), which they explained as focusing attention to the most important processes in creative idea generation. This deactivation was then proposed to interact with posterior parietal regions involved in inhibiting irrelevant processes. However, the current meta\u2010analysis found no evidence to support this, and we were not able to run any analyses on controls versus divergent thinking due to a lack of foci required to find activation in any areas. This could be due to the lack of studies that report contrasts in this direction, or the addition of recent studies, which use a variety of control tasks, leading to a spread of activations across inconsistent regions. \n\nAnalyses were also were performed on studies requiring only one response versus multiple responses per trial, which yielded no significant differences. This suggests that there are no differences, that we could detect, in brain regions activated during single compared to multiple responses. This supports developments in divergent thinking research; more efficient fMRI tasks can be run that focus on single responses, leaving more time to conduct more trials, or test multiple concepts without needing longer multiple response trials. \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nThis ALE analysis of fMRI studies of divergent thinking, is the first in this field to follow strict guidelines on conducting fMRI meta\u2010analyses. Nonetheless, it was limited in scope because a number of the studies included were conducted before the creation of best practice procedures (Eickhoff et al.,  ; M\u00fcller et al.,  ). In order to identify key ROIs, running an additional less conservative analysis assisted in a more accurate picture of where the literature currently sits. Divergent thinking, an aspect of creativity, which is one of the most difficult psychological phenomena to quantify scientifically, was tested using a range of methods. Notably, nine of the 20 studies did not require the subject to produce an overt creative response, but to think through creative response options, which were not recorded. Whilst recording responses in fMRI is challenging, one of the difficulties of not recording responses is that you cannot evaluate the creativity of the response. Additionally, for studies that did record the creative responses, regions active during the task were included in the analysis irrespective of the response. We know that creativity involves multiple components, and the long\u2010time blocks included in each analysis reflect this. Previous studies have revealed that particular regions are more responsive to certain aspects of creativity than others. One aspect of creativity is the evaluation of ideas, as well as the idea generation themselves. Evaluations of creativity have been said to entail several processes different to idea generation (Coubard, Duretz, Lefebvre, Lapalus, & Ferrufino,  ). For example, the left IFG has been found to be more activated during evaluations of ideas than during generation (Kleinmintz et al.,  ) and therefore peaks reported in this ALE that include the left IFG could reflect one or several creativity components. It is not possible to distinguish these roles within the current meta\u2010analysis. \n\nWhen comparing divergent tasks to a control, we are aiming to isolate the regions that are activated during the specific task, reflecting the processes that are taking place. However, a limitation of using control tasks, especially with DTTs, is all the control tasks rely on the semantic system. For example, the control task commonly associated with the AUT is the object characterisation task and required the semantic system to be able to recall and name characteristics of objects presented. We therefore may be cancelling out any activity that is relevant for assessing the relationship between divergent thinking and semantic control because of this. A study directly comparing the two concepts would be critical to elucidate the similarities and differences of these networks. \n\nFinally, an important distinction should be made between activity and connectivity of regions. This current meta\u2010analysis is able to comment on activity in regions during divergent tasks, however it is unclear whether this is as a direct result of the task itself, or whether functional coupling with other regions is the cause. More recent research has shown that functional coupling of the DMN and executive network supports creative idea production, particularly in older adults (Adnan, Beaty, Silvia, Spreng, & Turner,  ; Beaty et al.,  ) and therefore it is possible some regions we reported activity in are activated due to their connectivity with other regions, rather than as a result of the task itself. A dynamic causal modelling approach would be needed to suggest directional effective connectivity, and future research focusing on which regions show activity, and which connectivity, would provide important further insight into the neural correlates of divergent thinking. \n\n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nThis meta\u2010analysis is the first to explore activity to DTTs in the broader context of the semantic control network, as well as relating these regions to the default mode, executive control and MDNs. This analysis revealed a significant relationship between activity to divergent thinking and the semantic control network. There was an additional role for the online mental manipulation of objects from the IPL. Therefore, a distributed network is implicated in divergent thinking. However, it is likely that the regions are at least partially specialised, given the partial but not complete overlap with the semantic control network. This possibility remains to be further explored. \n\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST \n  \nThe authors confirm there are no potential sources of conflict of interest. \n\n\n## DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT \n  \nThe procedure followed for the meta\u2010analysis can be found in the Open Science Framework (OSF;  ).

Ten electronic databases have been searched, and further citation searching and reference checking will be employed. Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials assessing the impact of routine surveillance MRI to detect tumour recurrence in children with no new neurological signs or symptoms compared to alternative follow-up schedules including imaging upon presentation with disease signs or symptoms will be included. \n\nThe primary outcome is time to change in therapeutic intervention. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, surrogate survival outcomes, response rates, diagnostic yield per set of images, adverse events, quality of survival and validated measures of family psychological functioning and anxiety. Two reviewers will independently screen and select studies for inclusion. Quality assessment will be undertaken using the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s tools for assessing risk of bias. Where possible, data will be summarised using combined estimates of effect for time to treatment change, survival outcomes and response rates using assumption-free methods. Further sub-group analyses and meta-regression models will be specified and undertaken to explore potential sources of heterogeneity between studies within each tumour type if necessary. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAssessment of the impact of surveillance imaging in children with CNS tumours is methodologically complex. The evidence base is likely to be heterogeneous in terms of imaging protocols, definitions of radiological response and diagnostic accuracy of tumour recurrence due to changes in imaging technology over time. Furthermore, the delineation of tumour recurrence from either pseudo-progression or radiation necrosis after radiotherapy is potentially problematic and linked to the timing of follow-up assessments. However, given the current routine practice of MRI surveillance in the follow-up of children with CNS tumours in the UK and the resource implications, it is important to evaluate the cost-benefit profile of this practice. \n\n\n## Systematic review registration \n  \nPROSPERO  \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13643-016-0318-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nThe use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the diagnosis and management of children with central nervous system (CNS) tumours is well established [ ]. Surveillance scans complement periodic history taking and physical examination and are undertaken based on the assumption that a tumour can re-occur before symptoms appear and that detection and treatment of recurrent disease before the development of signs or symptoms may improve outcome. The scheduling and imaging techniques used for surveillance protocols are therefore loosely based on the biological characteristics of the different CNS tumour types, taking into account the rate of tumour growth, the location and patterns of local and metastatic recurrence [ ,  ]. \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging is a complex modality, with different sequences (protocols) being used by different centres, with the potential for scan results to be indeterminate. Clinicians face the challenge of diagnosing and managing patients that have new or old lesions seen on follow-up MRI and determining whether the lesion is pseudo-progression, radiation necrosis or tumour recurrence. This is further complicated by differences over time and between centres in radiological response definitions, complexities of scan interpretation and scan reader inter-rater reliability. \n\nObviously, earlier detection and treatment of recurrence needs to bestow a clinical benefit in terms of reduction in mortality or an improvement in quality of survival [ ] in order for early detection strategies to be worthwhile, and further treatment strategies need to be available to balance the risk-benefit profile of earlier detection. These risks include the need for sedation or anaesthesia in children, the negative psychological impact associated with an upcoming imaging session and the consequent results and, at a societal level, the direct and in-direct healthcare costs incurred with surveillance screening and changes in patient management strategies. \n\nThe impact of surveillance imaging has been assessed in children with different types of malignant CNS tumours including low- and high-grade gliomas [ \u2013 ], medulloblastoma [ ,  \u2013 ], ependymoma, [ ] and central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumours (CNS-PNETs) [ ]. However, differences in imaging schedules and modalities (including both computerised tomography (CT) and MRI), and a reliance upon case series studies, mean no consensus has been reached regarding the utility of surveillance imaging, the optimal interval for undertaking scans or the length of surveillance following diagnosis. Whilst appropriate assessment of the impact of routine MRI surveillance screening to detect tumour recurrence in children with either no new, stable or improved neurological signs or symptoms with malignant CNS tumours is methodologically challenging and needs to be founded on data from appropriately designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs), given its current use in the UK, it is important to assess the cost-benefit of this practice. To date, no systematic reviews have been conducted that evaluate the impact of this screening strategy compared to imaging upon presentation of signs or symptoms of recurrent disease. This review therefore aims to:   \nAssess the impact of routine MRI surveillance to detect tumour recurrence in children with either no new, stable or improved neurological signs or symptoms with CNS tumours compared to alternative follow-up practices, including periodic clinical history taking and physical examination and the use of non-routine imaging upon presentation with disease signs or symptoms \n  \nWhere possible, evaluate the effects of varying MRI screening intervals by tumour type and determine the optimum length of time for screening post initial diagnosis \n  \nIdentify gaps and methodological weaknesses in the current evidence base to inform the design and analysis of further RCTs and make recommendations on the need for further primary research \n  \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nStandard systematic review methodology aimed at minimising bias will be employed, and reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [ ]. The protocol for this review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016036802), available from  . The PRISMA for Protocols (PRISMA-P) checklist for the review is also included as Additional file  . \n\n### Data sources and searches \n  \nThis review forms part of a wider work programme of systematic reviews which aim to assess the effects of different interventions for the treatment of CNS tumours in children, adolescents and young adults. Searches have therefore been conducted for studies examining the effects of imaging, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy and biological therapies used alone or as part of a multimodality treatment regimen for all types of paediatric brain tumours. No study design filters have been applied to the searches. Specific details of the searches conducted are detailed below. \n\n#### Bibliographic databases \n  \nA comprehensive, broad search strategy was developed using a combination of medical subject headings (MeSH) and free-text terms. The searches were limited by date from 1985 to October week 4, 2015. No language or publication status restrictions were applied, and ongoing studies were included. \n\nThe searches for published studies were undertaken using the following databases: MEDLINE (OvidSP); MEDLINE In-Process Citations & Daily Update (OvidSP); EMBASE (OvidSP); Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (Wiley); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Wiley); CINAHL Plus (EBSCO); DARE (CRD website); and HTA (CRD website). The search strategy used for the MEDLINE search is reported in  . \n\nGrey literature, completed and on-going studies were identified by searches of NIH Clinical Trials ( ); Current Controlled Trials ( ); and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) ( ) \n\n\n#### Other sources \n  \nExperts in the field, from both the Project Advisory and Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) Groups, were contacted with a list of identified studies to find out whether they had knowledge of any further studies that had not been retrieved by the electronic searches. Reference lists of all studies included in the present review will be checked and citation searching undertaken in order to identify any further studies not retrieved by the electronic searches. \n\nAll identified references have been downloaded into Endnote X7 software for initial assessment and handling. Where flexibility is needed throughout the work programme for reference management and handling, Endnote software will be linked to bespoke Access databases in order facilitate sorting and manipulation of data items within indexed fields and abstracts. \n\n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nAll studies have been loosely \u2018tagged\u2019 according to the study design and type of intervention using the seven intervention categories outlined above. All studies \u2018tagged\u2019 as \u2018imaging protocols\u2019 will be used to form the potential pool from which studies will be screened against the specific inclusion criteria. Study selection will be undertaken by two reviewers working independently initially using the titles/abstracts from the pool of potential studies. Studies marked for inclusion by either reviewer will then undergo full independent text assessment. Any discrepancies will be resolved by recourse to the abstracts or full texts or through consensus with a third reviewer. A PRISMA flow chart illustrating the study selection process will be documented [ ]. \n\n\n### Inclusion/exclusion criteria \n  \n  \n Population  : Infants, children and young adults (up to age 25\u00a0years) with diagnoses of any type of CNS tumour that has either no new, stable or improved neurological signs or symptoms at the time of study recruitment. These include but are not limited to high- and low-grade gliomas (HGG and LGG), medulloblastoma, ependymoma and germ cell tumours. Studies that include both children and adults within the relevant populations will be included provided results are reported separately for children (defined as up to the age of 25). Likewise, data from studies including children with different CNS tumour types will be included provided that (a) data are reported separately by tumour type and (b) data are reported for ten or more participants with a specific type of tumour. \n  \n Interventions  : Routine interval follow-up MRI scans in children with either no new, stable or improved neurological signs or symptoms. These can be conducted at any screening interval determined within the primary study and include T2, T1, T1 with contrast, diffusion and FLAIR images. Studies that do not report the use of a post-operative MRI scan or use CT as the imaging modality at baseline will be excluded. Likewise, studies that use both MRI and CT scans for routine imaging surveillance will only be included if data are reported separately for children who underwent MRI scans. \n  \n Comparator  : Any alternative follow-up schedule, including the use of periodic clinical history taking and physical examination and non-routine scheduled MRI scan(s) conducted due to physical signs/symptoms of tumour progression or recurrence. \n  \n Outcomes  : The primary outcome is time to change in therapeutic intervention. Secondary outcomes are overall survival, surrogate survival outcomes, response rates, short- and long-term adverse events, diagnostic yield per set of images, quality of survival and validated measures of family psychological functioning and anxiety. \n  \n Study designs  : Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised comparative studies. All uncontrolled study designs and diagnostic test accuracy studies will be excluded. \n  \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nData will be recorded on a standard data extraction form developed in either Access or Excel. The data will be extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second for accuracy. Any discrepancies will be resolved by recourse to the paper. Data from studies with multiple publications will be extracted and reported as a single study. \n\nData will be extracted on general (study name, study group (if applicable), publication date(s), principal investigator/authors); eligibility and study participants (e.g. tumour type and location; grade; age, gender, prior treatment history); definition of radiographic recurrence and other outcomes; intervention and comparator: MRI sequencing schedule (including plane(s), weighting, contrast enhancement; number of scans; scanning intervals; diagnostic yield per set of images; concomitant therapy); treatment intent (curative or palliative), study design (randomised controlled trial or non-randomised comparative study), length of follow-up and timing of outcome assessments; outcome measures (protocol specified, where available and reported); results (time to change in therapeutic intervention; overall survival, surrogate survival outcomes, response rates, short- and long-term adverse events, quality of survival and measures of family psychological functioning and anxiety); analysis methods (ITT or per protocol) and the author\u2019s conclusions. \n\n\n### Assessment of risk of bias in studies \n  \nThe quality of RCTs and non-randomised comparative trials will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s risk of bias tool for randomised trials and ROBINS-I, respectively [ ,  ]. \n\nAdditional criteria will also be used to assess the adequacy of the sample size and methods of analyses and the likely external validity of the study. All assessment will be at the overall study level, not at the level of the individual outcomes. Quality assessment will be undertaken by one reviewer independently and checked for accuracy by a second. Any disagreements will be resolved by recourse to the study paper(s) and a third reviewer will be consulted where necessary. In addition to the methodological criteria listed above, the GRADE framework may be used to consider inconsistency between studies, precision of results, likelihood of publication bias and applicability of results to population(s) of interest [ ]. \n\n\n### Data synthesis and analysis \n  \n#### Narrative synthesis \n  \nA narrative synthesis of study results will be presented (including text, figures and tables), to provide adequate interpretation of study findings. Studies will be grouped by tumour type, treatment line (induction, consolidation, salvage) and imaging sequences (where possible). The outcomes considered include time to change in therapeutic intervention, overall survival, surrogate survival outcomes, response rates, diagnostic \u2018yield\u2019 rate, quality of survival and validated measures of family psychological functioning and anxiety. Therefore, outcomes will be expressed in terms of hazard ratios (HR; (adjusted or unadjusted)), risk ratios (RR) and weighted mean differences as appropriate. All analyses will be conducted per outcome, including all studies that have reported data for the outcome. \n\nWhere more than one RCT has addressed the same question within the same tumour type and treatment line, and they are considered to be clinically similar (based on patient population and imaging protocol), results will be combined in a standard pairwise meta-analysis using assumption-free methods. All analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis where possible, using the HR or RR as appropriate. \n\nHeterogeneity will be investigated visually using forest plots and statistically using the   I   and   Q   statistic [ ]. Heterogeneity will be formally investigated using sub-group analyses and meta-regression where sufficient data are available. It is anticipated that the effects of the following variables will be investigated: methodological quality of the primary studies; tumour type, location and grade; extent of resection; prior treatments (chemotherapy/radiotherapy/multimodal regimens); number of relapses; imaging protocols and imaging intervals. Other variables considered relevant on further examination of the literature or input from clinical experts may also be considered. The coefficient describing the effect of each variable on the outcome will be modelled, using a random effects model. All analyses will be conducted using RevMan (version 5.1) and STATA (STATA\u2122 for Windows, version 10.1, Stata Corp; College Station, TX). \n\n##### Assessment of small study effects \n  \nFor each meta-analysis containing ten or more studies, the likelihood of small study effects and publication bias, namely the tendency for smaller studies to provide more positive findings, will be assessed using a modified linear regression test for funnel plot asymmetry as recommended where there are sufficient numbers of trials (i.e. six trials) [ ]. \n\n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe methodology used to conduct this review has been designed to be robust, comprehensive and minimise bias. However, it is anticipated there will be a number of limitations with the review. The assessment of the impact of routine MRI surveillance in children with malignant CNS tumours is complex and presents a number of methodological challenges. These relate to the natural history of the tumour types and highly different baseline risks of progression [ ], differences in imaging technologies and definitions of radiological response between studies and changes in both of these over time, the type of imaging protocols and schedules selected and the complexity of scan interpretation and inter-rater reliability. Furthermore, the assessment and measurement of time from initial diagnosis to change in therapeutic intervention as the appropriate outcome is important, as measures of overall or surrogate survival outcomes will be confounded by changes in the treatment pathway due to potentially earlier radiological tumour recurrence detection. In terms of time to change in therapeutic intervention, the concepts of lead time and length bias are well documented in the screening literature [ ], with lead-time bias minimised by measuring this outcome from initial diagnosis, not from the time of tumour recurrence [ ]. Differences in time to change in therapeutic intervention due to recurrence associated with length bias; whereby longer time to change in therapeutic intervention may be due to inherent differences in the baseline tumour characteristics rather than due to earlier detection can be minimised through the use of adequately randomised, and therefore balanced, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) [ ]. Whilst limiting the evidence base to controlled trials should strengthen the robustness of the evidence base, it may restrict the breath of the review where no trials for some tumour types or disease stages are available. This will impact the utility of the review results for informing decision-making on the wider effectiveness of surveillance MRI screening in children with CNS tumours. However, given the current routine practice of MRI surveillance in the follow-up of children with CNS tumours, it is important to evaluate the cost-benefit profile of this practice and the impact of different screening intervals in a methodologically robust manner. \n\n\n## Dissemination \n  \nTo ensure that our finding have clinical impact on patients, their parents and the physicians who care for them, results will be disseminated broadly by presenting at scientific conferences, published in peer-reviewed journals and through our Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) Partners who work for established high-profile UK brain tumour charities and our Clinical Steering Group. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5006428, "text_md5": "b4e7a590f1c62a458b6a15703b77e4c4", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 193], "journal": [194, 202], "publication_year": [204, 208], "title": [219, 435], "keywords": [449, 571], "abstract": [584, 3366], "body": [3375, 21075]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 27577246, "doi": "10.1186/s13643-016-0318-1", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5006428", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5006428"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5006428\">5006428</a>", "list_title": "PMC5006428  The impact of routine surveillance screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect tumour recurrence in children with central nervous system (CNS) tumours: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis"}

Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems have been developed for accurate and automated PCa detection and diagnosis, but the diagnostic accuracy of different CAD systems based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for PCa remains controversial. The aim of this study is to systematically review the published evidence to investigate diagnostic accuracy of different CAD systems based on MRI for PCa. \n\n\n## Methods: \n  \nWe will conduct the systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines.

The quality of reporting evidence will be assessed using the quality assessment of diagnosis accuracy study (QUADAS-2) tool. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves will be calculated to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of CAD system. In addition, we will conduct subgroup analyses according to the type of classifier of CAD systems used and the different prostate zoon. \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nThis study will conduct a meta-analysis of current evidence to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of CAD systems based on MRI for PCa by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and SROC curves. \n\n\n## Conclusion: \n  \nThe conclusion of this study will provide evidence to judge whether CAD systems based on MRI have high diagnostic accuracy for PCa. \n\n\n## Ethics and dissemination: \n  \nEthics approval is not required for this systematic review as it will involve the collection and analysis of secondary data. The results of the review will be reported in international peer-reviewed journals. \n\n\n## Prospero registration number: \n  \nCRD42019132543. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIt is estimated that almost 1.3 million new cases of prostate cancer (PCa) and 359,000 associated deaths worldwide in 2018, accounting for 7.1% of the total new cancers diagnosed worldwide, ranking as the second most frequent cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in men.  PCa is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men in over 1-half (105 of 185) of the countries of the world, notably in the Americas, Northern and Western Europe. And it is the leading cause of cancer death among men in 46 countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. \n\nTherefore, reliable and early detection of PCa has become an important priority in the field of urologic oncology. For the past 25 years, Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has always been the gold standard for the diagnosis of PCa, followed by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy, which has resulted in decreased PCa mortality by 20% to 30%,  but with significant diagnostic errors in undersampling and understaging PCa and resulting in overtreatment related morbidity such as incontinence and impotence.  Over the past decade, multi-parametric MR imaging (mp-MRI), has become the dominant non-invasive diagnostic tool for diagnosing and grading PCa.  3 Tesla mp-MRI enables detection of 50% of all PCa lesions and 80% of clinically significant lesions. \n\nHowever, one of the main limitations of the mp-MRI is that its interpretation requires experienced radiologists capable of analyzing data extracted from the different MR sequences, which may lead to high inter- and intra-reader variability in diagnosis.  Therefore, automated and accurate PCa detection from mp-MRI sequences is of high demand for minimizing reading time, alleviating requirement for expertise in radiology reading, reducing risk of over-/under-treatment, and enabling large-scale PCa screening. \n\nIn the past decade, several computer-aided systems  (CADs) have been developed for accurate and automated PCa detection and diagnosis. An increasing number of studies indicated that the CAD systems have the potential to support the radiologist by indicating suspicious regions and reducing oversight and perception errors.  In addition, some CAD applications have been shown to be time efficient;  However, the diagnostic test accuracy of different CAD systems is still controversial. \n\nThe aim of the study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to: \n  \nevaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CAD system based on MRI images of the prostate and provides a malignancy assessment; \n  \ndetermine which classifier of CAD system is superior for the diagnosis of PCa; \n  \ndetermine whether the performance of the CAD system depends on the specific regions of the prostate. \n  \n\n## Methods \n  \nThis research protocol has been developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P),  and we will conduct the systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines. \n\nThe protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42019132543). \n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \n#### Types of study \n  \nWe will include all studies that investigated diagnostic accuracy of CAD systems based on MRI in adult patients with suspected PCa. Included studies should have sufficient information to build a 2\u200a\u00d7\u200a2 contingency table (true positive [TP], false positive [FP], true negative [TN], false negative [FN]). Case\u2013control studies will be excluded when the control group entails healthy volunteers as they are not representative of the population in which CAD will be performed. \n\n\n#### Participants \n  \nWe will include studies that evaluate patients 18 years of age or older and with suspected PCa. \n\n\n#### Setting \n  \nOur study will include participants from different clinical settings, such as hospital wards, emergency departments, and intensive care units. \n\n\n#### Index test \n  \nWe will include studies that CAD system was used to diagnose PCa, and study data was based on MRI. \n\n\n#### Reference standards \n  \nBiopsy should serve as the reference standard. \n\n\n\n### Exclusion criteria \n  \nWe will exclude the studies in which the information of a 2\u200a\u00d7\u200a2 contingency table are lacking, and cannot be calculated from the text or appendices; and duplicated articles, review articles, editorials, case reports, summaries, animal and cell studies, meta-analysis, letters, editorials, comments, and other irrelevant article types will be also excluded. \n\n\n### Search strategy \n  \nFollowing databases will be systematically researched for relevant studies: Cochrane library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM) from their inception. There will be no restrictions placed on document language or publication status. A search strategy will be developed to define subject headings and keywords for all searches. Specific search strategies (e.g., for PubMed) are as follows: (\u201cprostatic neoplasm\u2217\u201d OR \u201cprostate neoplasm\u2217\u201d OR \u201cprostate cancer\u2217\u201d OR \u201cprostatic cancer\u2217\u201d OR \u201cprostate tumor\u2217\u201d OR \u201cprostatic tumor\u2217\u201d) AND (\u201cartificial intelligence\u201d OR \u201cdeep learning\u201d OR \u201ccomputer-assisted\u201d OR \u201cmachine learning\u201d OR \u201cneural network\u2217\u201d OR \u201cartificial inligence\u201d OR \u201cAI\u201d OR \u201ccomputational intelligence\u201d OR \u201cmachine intelligence\u201d OR \u201ccomputer reasoning\u201d OR \u201cautomated\u201d) AND (\u201cdiagnosis\u201d OR \u201cdiagnos\u2217\u201d OR \u201cdetection\u201d OR \u201csensitivity\u201d OR \u201cspecificity\u201d OR \u201caccuracy\u201d, \u201cpositive likelihood\u201d OR \u201cnegative likelihood\u201d OR \u201cROC\u201d).We will also contact leading authors and experts in the field of PCa for additional studies via email. The bibliographies of relevant reviews and included studies will be used to identify additional references for review. Finally, we will transfer all relevant titles and abstracts to Endnote Web for selection. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nAfter the removal of duplicate results, the selection of potential articles reviews will be done first by title and then by abstract by 2 independent authors (LMX and CLJ). At this stage, we will exclude studies that were not described as CAD for PCa diagnosis based on MRI. Then, the full text of each potential study will be assessed for inclusion. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion and consensus, or by consulting a third member (L-Y) of the review team. The details of study selection process will be presented in the PRISMA flow chart (shown in Fig.  ). \n  \nPreferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses flow chart of study selection process. \n  \n\n### Data extraction \n  \nAccording to the characteristics of included studies, 2 reviewers will independently extract the following information: \n  \nBasic characteristics of included studies: first author, year of publication, country, patient numbers, patient ages, study design, PSA (ng/ml), testing set, reference standard; \n  \nThe details of different CAD systems: field strength, classifier, Steps of CAD System, Imaging sequence used in system. \n  \nDiagnostic data: true positive (TP), TN, FP, FN, Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity. \n  \nIf there are any discrepancies, they will discuss and resolve by consensus with a third reviewer. \n  \n\n### Methodological quality assessment \n  \nTwo authors (LMX and LHJ) will independently evaluate the methodological quality of each eligible study using the quality assessment of diagnosis accuracy study (QUADAS-2) tool;  discrepancies will be discussed and resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (YL). The tool is a newly revised quality assessment tool developed specifically for the systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies, which comprises 4 domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, flow, and timing. Each is assessed in terms of risk of bias and the first 3 in terms of concerns regarding applicability. Signaling questions are included to assist in judgments about risk of bias. And each question is answered with \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, \u201cunclear\u201d, the level of risk of bias can be judged as \u201clow risk\u201d \u201chigh risk\u201d \u201cunclear risk\u201d homologous. Finally, Review Manager 5.3 software will be used to evaluate the risk of bias of each included study and draw the risk of bias\u2019 figure. \n\n\n### Quality of the evidence \n  \nA Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for diagnostic tests has now been developed, which provides guidance on how to translate accuracy data into a recommendation involving patient-important outcomes.  We will apply the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nWe will first extract the 2\u200a\u00d7\u200a2 contingency table (TP, FP, TN, FN). Some of the primary studies did not directly give all the data in the 2\u200a\u00d7\u200a2 tables, we will calculate the missing data based on the existing data in the text or appendices in each primary study using the calculator in Review Manager 5.3. Using these tables, we determined the true-positive rate (TPR; sensitivity) the true-negative rate (TNR; specificity), a descriptive forest plot and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves will be derived by Review Manager 5.3. And the stata12.0 software will be also used to develop forest plot so as to present the sensitivity and specificity and their pooled results. SROC curves are defined by sensitivity (y-axis) and specificity (x-axis), respectively, and each data point represents 1 particular study, and the area under the curve (AUC) is the final comparison indicator. The criteria for AUC classification are 0.90 to 1 (excellence), 0.80 to 0.90 (good), 0.70 to 0.80 (fair), 0.60 to 0.70 (poor), and 0.50 to 0.60 (failure). \n\n\n### Assessment of heterogeneity \n  \nInitially, to examine heterogeneity, we will visually inspect forest plots of each study's sensitivities and specificities as well as ROC curves related to the individual study results. Statistical heterogeneity will be evaluated informally from forest plots of the study estimates and more formally using the \u03c72 test (  P  \u200a<.1, significant heterogeneity) and I  statistic (I  >50%\u200a=\u200asignificant heterogeneity). In addition, different diagnostic thresholds of included studies may lead to heterogeneity; we will use the Spearman correlation coefficients to test whether there is a threshold effect. When there is a threshold effect, sensitivity and specificity will be negatively correlated, and the results will present a \u201cshoulder-arm\u201d point distribution on the SROC curve. \n\n\n### Subgroup analysis \n  \nWe will conduct subgroup analyses according to: \n  \nthe type of classifier of CAD systems used to determine which classifier of CAD system is superior for the diagnosis of PCa; \n  \nThe specific regions of the prostate (peripheral zone, transitional zone, and central gland), to investigate whether the CAD diagnostic accuracy depends on the prostate zoon. \n  \n\n### Assessment of publication bias \n  \nIf a sufficient number of studies are identified, we will investigate publication biases by Deek's funnel plot.  We will interpret publication bias with care because this test lacks statistical power, and adequate methods to detect publication bias in diagnostic test accuracy reviews have not been agreed on. \n\n\n### Patient and public involvement \n  \nNeither patients nor public got involved. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAlthough there is some evidence on the accuracy of CAD in the diagnosis of PCa, evidence is limited and was not systematically reviewed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that will systematically review CAD for PCa diagnosis based on MRI. Greater scientific rigour is necessary when establishing a diagnostic strategy that represents current evidence accurately, and we will also conduct subgroup analyses according to the type of classifier of CAD systems used and the different prostate zoon. \n\nWe will conduct a systemic review of CAD system based on MRI for the diagnosis of PCa using appropriate methodologies and quality assessment tools that may feed into an evidence-based clinical practice. This will be the first systematic review to directly compare the diagnostic accuracy of CAD system based on MRI to a reference standard of PCa. \n\nThe major limitation is that the results from this systematic review will be highly dependent on the quality of the underlying primary studies, which will be mainly retrospective studies. Another possible limitation of this study, is its susceptibility to publication and small sample biases, and may not be generalisable to other settings. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Data curation:   Meixuan Li, Huijuan Li. \n\n Formal analysis:   Xiaoqin Wang, Huijuan Li, Yumeng Song. \n\n Funding acquisition:   Jieting Liu. \n\n Methodology:   Fuxiang Liang, Meixuan Li, Liang Yao. \n\n Project administration:   Bing Song. \n\n Resources:   Jieting Liu. \n\n Software:   Meixuan Li. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   Fuxiang Liang, Meixuan Li. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Fuxiang Liang, Meixuan Li, Liang Yao, Liujiao Cao, Shidong Liu, Bing Song. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6708830, "text_md5": "ad474b40121c26a52ff52fe6d7ed9c15", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 162], "journal": [163, 183], "publication_year": [185, 189], "title": [200, 290], "keywords": [304, 415], "abstract": [428, 2594], "body": [2603, 15665]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31335680, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000016326", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6708830", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6708830"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6708830\">6708830</a>", "list_title": "PMC6708830  Computer-aided detection for prostate cancer diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imaging"}

Despite clinical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of ST36 acupuncture, the brain activities and the neural mechanism following acupuncture at ST36 remain unclear. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nLiterature searches were conducted on online databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, WeiPu database, and China Biology Medicine, for task-based fMRI studies of acupuncture at ST36 in healthy subjects. Brain regions activated by ST36 acupuncture were systematically evaluated and subjected to seed-based   d   mapping meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted on control procedures, manual acupuncture, electrical acupuncture (EA), and acupuncture-specific activations. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the effects of needle retention time on brain activities following ST36 acupuncture stimulation. The activated brain regions were further decoded and mapped on large-scale functional networks to further decipher the clinical relevance of acupuncturing at ST36. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of sixteen studies, involving a total of 401 right-handed healthy participants, that satisfied the inclusion criteria were included in the present meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncturing on ST36 positively activates the opercular part of the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG.R), left superior temporal gyrus (STG.L), and right median cingulate/paracingulate gyri (MCG.R) regions. Needle retention time in an acupuncture session positively correlates with the activation of the left olfactory cortex, as shown in meta-regression analysis. Subgroup analysis revealed that EA stimulation may be a source of heterogeneity in the pooled results. Functional network mappings showed that the activated areas were mapped to the auditory network and salience network. Further functional decoding analysis showed that acupuncture on ST36 was associated with pain, secondary somatosensory, sound and language processing, and mood regulation. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAcupuncture at ST36 in healthy individuals positively activates the opercular part of IFG.R, STG.L, and MCG.R. The left olfactory cortex may exhibit positive needle retention time-dependent activities. Our findings may have clinical implications for acupuncture in analgesia, language processing, and mood disorders. \n\n\n## Systematic Review Registration \n  \n. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAcupuncture, an ancient technique in traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat various conditions for thousands of years and has been widely accepted as an important modality of complementary therapy in modern medicine ( ). Evidence has shown that acupuncture improves cerebral circulation, relieves pain, and modulates neural function ( ,  ). The   deqi   sensation is the arrival of Qi, is the special feeling and reaction of the human body after filiform needles are inserted into an acupoint, and is also the key to the effect of acupuncture. It is believed that acupuncture excites afferent nerve receptors, stimulating signals that alter the central nervous system's signal integration ( ). However, it is difficult to establish the central nervous effects of acupuncture in humans due to the diversity of acupoints for various clinical settings and inadequate trials. \n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying acupuncture-related neural activities with advanced functional neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography, and electroencephalography ( ,  ). fMRI measures the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of the brain tissue, or more specifically, the oxygen demand surge in a brain region with increased neural activities, thus localizing the activity fluctuations of the brain ( ). With a task-based design, fMRI is capable of measuring the temporal effects of acupuncture and capturing the activated brain regions' responses to stimulations ( ). \n\nIt is important to identify the acupuncture-stimulated brain regions, which may help to elucidate the neural mechanisms of acupuncture. Among 720 acupoints on the human body, ST36 (Stomach 36,   zusanli  ) is a commonly used acupoint in animal studies ( ) and clinical practices for gastric disorders, stroke, pain, sleep disturbances, and some psychological diseases ( \u2013 ). Recent evidence from animal experiments has shown the neuroanatomical basis of ST36 in driving the vagal\u2013adrenal axis, thus modulating anti-inflammatory responses in mice ( ). Research in healthy individuals demonstrated the effects of ST36 in the somatosensory and motor areas, cerebellum, and limbic system ( ,  ). A meta-analysis on block-design fMRI, including both patients and healthy individuals, demonstrated that acupuncture at ST36 with   deqi   sensation exclusively activates the right hemisphere of the brain, such as the right orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right median cingulate, and paracingulate gyri, right supramarginal gyrus, and pons ( ). Moreover, Bai et al. reported the time-varied effects of acupuncture at ST36 in fMRI ( ,  ), indicating time-dependent modes of brain activity responses to acupuncture. \n\nWithout prior clinical conditions, healthy individuals are ideal subjects to identify the specific brain activities following acupuncture. Some studies have shown increased brain activities in the insula ( ,  ), bilateral primary somatosensory area and the ipsilateral cerebellum, anterior cingulate cortex, superior temporal gyrus (STG) ( \u2013 ), primary visual cortex pons, medulla regions ( ), and supplementary motor area ( ) when acupuncture was performed on ST36 in healthy individuals; however, other studies have yielded heterogeneous results of attenuated signals in limbic and paralimbic structures, including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus, cortices of the subgenual and retrosplenial cingulate, ventromedial pre-frontal cortex, frontal, and temporal poles ( ,  ), primary somatosensory (SI) cortex, secondary somatosensory (SII) cortex ( ), and precuneus ( ). Despite clinical fMRI studies of ST36 acupuncture, there is yet a consensus on the temporal neural activities following acupuncture at ST36 among healthy subjects. \n\nIn the present work, we summarized the current evidence of task-based fMRI studies of acupuncture at ST36 in healthy individuals with the seed-based   d   mapping (SDM) technique and functional network mapping and decoding analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted to assess the sources of heterogeneity between manual acupuncture (MA) and electrical acupuncture (EA). Additional subgroup analysis was also conducted on control procedures (sham acupuncture, control point acupuncture, and sensory tactile stimulation) and acupuncture-specific activations to further understand the brain activation patterns of acupuncture at ST36. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the potential confounding effects of needle retention time in correlation with brain activities following ST36 acupuncture stimulation. Specifically, since many studies omitted cerebellar activations, the present study focused only on the activations located in the cerebrum. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nA systematic review and meta-analysis of the neural activities of ST36 acupuncture stimulation in healthy subjects was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and for Acupuncture (PRISMA-A) guidelines and published research protocol on INPLASY (INPLASY2021120035). \n\n### Search Strategy \n  \nWe searched for studies indexed in the following online databases from inception to September 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, WeiPu database, and China Biology Medicine. The following terms were used for the search: (\u201cST 36\u201d or \u201cST36\u201d or \u201c  zusanli  \u201d) and (\u201cfMRI\u201d or \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d). Titles and abstracts were independently screened by two authors, and the bibliographies of the articles were checked for additional retrievable relevant studies. \n\n\n### Eligibility Criteria \n  \nStudies were selected if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) published studies on single acupoint stimulation (c) conducted on at least 10 healthy subjects; (2) including the demographic information of the study sample; (3) conducting whole-brain analysis on task-based fMRI data; and (4) reporting the peak stimulation coordinates in standardized anatomic space, such as Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, with corresponding cluster size and statistics (voxel-wise   p  -values,   z   values, or   t   scores). Studies were excluded from the final analysis if they were (1) analyses of the region-of-interest level or (2) reviews, meta-analyses, or animal studies. \n\n\n### Outcome Measurement \n  \n#### Main Outcomes \n  \nThe main outcomes are significantly activated brain regions in Talairach/MNI coordinates with corresponding cluster statistics (voxel-wise   p  -values,   z   values, or   t   scores) for baseline vs. activation comparison on ST36 acupuncturing or control procedures, for an instant, sham acupuncture, control point acupuncture, and sensory tactile stimulation. \n\n\n#### Secondary Outcomes \n  \nThe secondary outcomes are the two-sample (or group-level) comparison among acupuncture stimulation at ST36 and control procedures (sham acupuncture, control point acupuncture, and sensory tactile stimulation) regarding significantly activated brain regions (in Talairach/MNI coordinate) with corresponding cluster statistics (voxel-wise   p  -values,   z   values, or   t   scores) between groups. \n\n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nThere were two authors independently extracted data from the original studies using a predesigned data extraction form. The following information was collected: first author's name, publication year, studied region, ethnicity, sex, sample size, dominant hand of the participants, experimental design, intervention, MRI acquisition protocols, neuroimaging processing software, and the coordinate system used in reporting of the results, as well as the correction method. Any discrepancies were resolved by referring to the original articles or consulting the lead author. \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis Procedures \n  \nFor the SDM meta-analysis, peak stimulated brain regions with cluster statistics (  p  -values or   z   values or   t   scores) were also collected. In general, the studies reported either Talairach or MNI coordinates, a text file renamed to the first author containing peak coordinates, and the associated   t   score was created. Additionally, a datasheet, including the first author's name,   t   threshold for significant clusters, number of participants in the experiment, and control groups, was created. For studies that reported multiple comparisons, the results of the acupuncture (ST36) and sham tests were recorded. For studies that reported   p  -values or   z   values, the statistics were converted to   t   scores using the online SDM converter. If a study did not provide information about the   t   threshold or corrected   p  -value, the minimum   t   score was used as a conservative estimation. Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI, version 6.2.2) is used in the current work to summarize the peak coordinates of brain activities in ST36 acupuncture stimulation (family-wise error-corrected followed by threshold free cluster enhancement with 1,000 permutations), and the results are thresholded to the statistical significance level of voxel-wise   p   < 0.005 with a cluster threshold of 50 voxels. An approach was adopted by conducting full analyses after iteratively leaving one of the included studies' datasets out to test the robustness of the results. Heterogeneity analyses with   I   statistics were carried out to examine the interstudy heterogeneity of individual clusters, and   I   > 30% was defined as major heterogeneity. \n\nSubgroup analysis was performed for the control procedures, such as sham acupuncture, control point acupuncture, and sensory tactile stimulation. The effects of MA and EA stimulation were also analyzed to explore the difference in brain activation under different stimulation intensities. Additional subgroup analysis was conducted in studies that reported direct comparisons between the ST36 acupuncture and control procedures to unmask the acupuncture-specified activated brain regions. \n\nThe needle retention time was meta-regressed as a variate to study the time-dependent heterogeneity of the activation in the brain during acupuncture at ST36. In the present meta-regression, if there were multiple stimulation blocks, the scanning length of the first stimulation block was regarded as the needle retention time (min). If the study measured the brain activities for a prolonged period after one stimulation was applied and reported a series of activations with the time the activations appeared, the time (min) an activation was detected was regarded as the needle retention time. The data were extracted according to different needle retention times. For the exploratory nature of meta-regression, stringent thresholds were applied (voxel-wise   p   < 0.0005 and cluster size > 50 voxels) to decrease false-positive findings. \n\nThe included studies were placed into a non-randomized comparative design; thus, methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) ( ) was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. Publication bias was assessed by graphical inspection of the asymmetry of the funnel plot for the   z   score and evaluated through Egger's test. \n\n\n### Mapping on Brain Network and Functional Decoding \n  \nTo decipher the meta-analysis results at the network level, the identified ST36 brain activations in the meta-analysis were mapped onto large-scale functional networks based on whole-brain functional connectivity analysis ( ). To further interpret the function of the identified brain regions, we used the Neurosynth database ( ) for data-driven functional decoding. Briefly, relevant terms for which the meta-analysis map showed the largest correlations with the identified brain regions were extracted, and terms with similar functional meanings were merged and retained the largest correlation value. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study Characteristics \n  \nA total of 16 studies were retrieved in the preliminary literature search. All 16 studies satisfied the eligibility criteria ( ,  ,  \u2013 ,  \u2013 ). The detailed search processes are presented in the PRISMA flowchart in  . In total, 401 right-handed healthy participants consisting of 199 male and 202 female subjects were included in the current study. The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in  . A total of two included studies were conducted in the United States, 12 studies were conducted in China, 1 study was conducted in Korea, and the remaining study was conducted in Germany. Interventions included acupuncture at ST36 with   deqi   sensation with manual manipulations or electrical stimulation, whereas the control procedures included sham acupuncture, control point acupuncture, and local anesthesia before acupuncture at ST36. All the included studies involved applying different stimulations to the same group (or partially the same group) of subjects with a multi-block design or in different sessions. A total of eleven studies conducted acupuncture at the right ST36, 3 studies conducted acupuncture at the left ST36, 1 study stimulated bilateral ST36, and 1 study performed MA at the right ST36 and EA on the left ST36. Neuroimages were acquired through a 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner. Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) were the dominant neuroimaging processing software among the included studies, and all results were reported in Talairach and MNI coordinate systems. Studies that reported activations from different stimulation procedures were extracted separately for subsequent subgroup analysis. Finally, baseline vs. activation results from 13 studies of verum acupuncture were used to synthesize the pooled effects of acupuncture at ST36 ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ), and baseline vs. activation results from 6 studies were pooled for the control procedure effects ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n  \nThe PRISMA flow diagram of the detailed search and literature selection processes. fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging. \n    \nThe characteristics of the included studies. \n  \n MA, manual acupuncture; EA, electric acupuncture; CP, control point; NA, not available  . \n  \n\n### Methodology Assessments \n  \nThe potential methodological quality of the study and risk of bias were examined through the MINORS tool. Most of the studies failed to address the unbiased assessment process (blind to the evaluation of the end points, item 5), and none of the studies mentioned the sample size calculations or power estimation. Due to no current optimal standard of interventions for the neural effect of acupuncture (positive control), the included studies adopted negative control approaches, such as control point acupuncture, pressure or sensory tactile stimulation of the skin, control point acupuncture, and local anesthesia. We rated items 9 to 1 for all the studies. Hence, the overall MINORS scores ranged from 17 to 21. \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis \n  \nThe meta-analysis shows that acupuncture at ST36 positively activates three brain clusters (  and  ), namely, the opercular part of right IFGr (IFG. R; Brodmann area 48; 4946 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 48, 12, 2; peak SDM-  Z  : 5.447;   p   < 0.001; extended to right insula, Rolandic operculum, supramarginal gyrus, and STG regions), left superior temporal gyrus (STG. L; 3,095 voxels; peak MNI coordinate: \u221246, \u22126, \u22126; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.893;   p   < 0.001; extended to left insula, Rolandic operculum, middle temporal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus regions), and right median cingulate/paracingulate gyri (MCG. R; Brodmann area 32; 914 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 4, 14, 44; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.570;   p   < 0.001; extended to left median cingulate/paracingulate gyri, left anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyri, and left supplementary motor area). On the other hand, control stimulation procedures positively activate brain regions similar to but smaller than those in verum acupuncture except for MCG. R ( ), such as the right Rolandic operculum (Brodmann area 48; 1648 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 54, \u221214, 14; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.719;   p   < 0.001), left postcentral gyrus (Brodmann area 43; 489 voxels; peak MNI coordinate: \u221258, \u221212, 32; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.139;   p   < 0.001), and right insula (Brodmann area 47; 55 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 36, 22, 2; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.717;   p   < 0.001). No negative activation was identified in the verum acupuncture or control stimulations. Except for MCG.R (  I   = 21.607% < 30%), the heterogeneity   I   values for the remaining identified clusters were <10%, indicating no heterogeneity among the studies. The jackknife sensitivity analysis revealed that the pooled activation regions for acupuncture at ST36 were preserved, except that MCG.R failed to be identified while excluding Napadow et al.'s study ( ) on EA intensity ( ), indicating that the activation of these areas might be associated with electric stimulation or stimulus strength. Left- and right-side stimulation could be confounding to the analysis, and we performed additional sensitivity analysis on the main outcomes with x-axis flipped results from left ST36 stimulation studies to reduce false-negative errors from the meta-analysis. Similar outcomes were shown, indicating robustly activated regions during acupuncture at ST36 (  and  ). The funnel plots of the identified clusters in ST36 acupuncture were roughly symmetric, and Egger's test did not detect significant publication biases (  p   < 0.05). \n  \nThe brain regions activated by acupuncture at ST36.

A total of two subgroup analyses were conducted among 8 studies that adopted manual manipulation techniques ( ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ,  ) and 5 studies that performed EA ( ,  \u2013 ,  ). The results ( ) showed that manual manipulation techniques positively activated the right supramarginal gyrus (Brodmann area 2; 158 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 66, \u221222, 32; peak SDM-  Z  : 5.841;   p   < 0.001) and opercular part of right IFG (Brodmann area 48; 113 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 48, 12, 2; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.586;   p   = 0.003). Interestingly, EA positively activates wider areas ( ), such as the left superior frontal gyrus, medial orbital (Brodmann area 11; 2679 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: \u22126, 42, \u22128; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.003;   p   < 0.001), STG. R (Brodmann area 42; 2,095 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 60, \u221222, 16; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.391;   p   < 0.001), STG. L (1,167 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: \u221246, \u22124, 0; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.197;   p   < 0.001), and left anterior thalamic projections (819 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: \u221212, 14, 6; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.323;   p   < 0.001). The subgroup analysis results of the manual manipulation techniques and EA indicated that electric stimulation could be the major source of heterogeneity in the pooled results. \n\nA total of five of the included studies reported group-level comparisons of verum acupuncture and control stimulations ( ,  \u2013 ); hence, an additional subgroup analysis was conducted to address another interest of the present study to identify the specified brain activations of acupuncture. Compared to control stimulations, a small area located in the right supramarginal gyrus (Brodmann area 42; 86 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: 62, \u221224, 18; peak SDM-  Z  : 4.714;   p   < 0.001) was activated specifically following acupuncture on ST36 ( ). \n\n\n### Meta-Regression Analysis \n  \nTo investigate the potential effects of needle retention time, a meta-regression analysis was conducted with the mixed-effects model. The meta-regression results (  and  ) showed that activation in the left olfactory cortex (Brodmann area 42; 163 voxels; peak MNI coordinates: \u22124, 24, \u221212; peak SDM-  Z  : 3.790;   p   < 0.0005) was positively associated with needle retention time [effect size: 0.083 95% CI (0.045, 0.120),   p   < 0.001]. \n  \nMeta-regression of the relationship between needle retention time and the estimated effect size of the left olfactory cortex. \n    \nThe brain region related to needle retention time. \n  \n MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; SDM, Seed-based d mapping; BA, Brodmann Area  . \n  \n\n### Large-Scale Brain Network Mapping and Functional Decoding \n  \nThe activated brain regions following acupuncture on ST36 were mapped on the large-scale functional network atlas, showing that the majority of voxels mapped to the auditory network, anterior salience network, and posterior salience network, and some small regions were mapped to the visuospatial network, language network, and dorsal default-mode network (DMN). To further decipher the functional effects of ST36 acupuncture, a neurosynth decoding analysis was performed. As shown in  , which depicts the functional profiles, acupuncture on ST36 was associated with SII stimulation, such as pain, touch, tactile, and electrical stimulation; sound and language processing, such as auditory sensory and speech; and mood regulation ( ). The full list of the decoding results is recorded in  . \n  \nBrain network mapping of the brain regions activated by acupuncture at ST36. \n  \n DMN, default mode network; ECN, executive control network  . \n    \nThe relevant decoded functions of acupuncture at ST36. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe introduction of fMRI technology is advantageous to acupuncture research in that neural-therapeutic mechanisms of the (de)activation of brain regions under acupuncture intervention can be accessed on an image-referencing basis. Studies have shown that acupuncture of ST36 induces multiple activations of relevant brain regions, including the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, postcentral and cingulate gyri, insula, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and other limbic systems ( ,  ), but the results were based on relatively small sample size and heterogeneous. The present work is a meta-analysis summarizing task-based fMRI studies of ST36 acupuncture in healthy individuals. The pooled results showed the opercular part of IFG. R, STG. L, and MCG. R regions were positively activated following ST36 acupuncturing, and no negative activations were detected. Functional network mappings of the identified clusters revealed that the activated areas were located in the auditory network, anterior salience network, and posterior salience network. Further functional decoding implied that our findings may help to elucidate the neural targets of acupuncture at ST36 for pain, speech, and mood disorder management. \n\nStomach 36 has been an important acupoint for improving gastrointestinal function and enhancing physical fitness since ancient China. ST36 is located in the tibialis anterior muscle four fingers beneath the lower patella margin and one finger aside from the anterior border of the tibia and is thought to strengthen the spleen and stomach, relax the meridians, activate collaterals, and strengthen the body in Chinese medicine theory. ST36 acupuncture is popular for analgesia, cognitive function and cerebral circulation improvement, and gastrointestinal disease regulation in modern practices. Studies on cerebral infarction patients and animal models have reported that acupuncture at ST36 improves brain metabolites and memory function and promotes motor function, indicating neural and cognitive recovery promoting the effects of acupuncture ( ,  ). Moreover, acupuncture at ST36 has neuroprotective effects in hydrocephalus infantile rats, exhibiting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects   via   inhibition of reactive astrogliosis ( ). \n\nIn the present study, we mainly focused on temporal brain activities following an acupuncture session. We found that acupuncture at ST36 positively activates the opercular part of IFG. R, STG. L, and MCG. R, which is consistent with the conclusions of another meta-analysis that reported brain activations following acupuncture at ST36 with   deqi   sensation in subjects with varying background health situations ( ). The clusters of the opercular part of IFG. R and STG. L were stable in jackknife analysis, indicating the robust activation of these regions during ST36 acupuncturing. The IFG and STG regions, involved in the classic Wernicke\u2013Lichtheim\u2013Geschwind language processing model ( ), are the important components of the auditory network that are in line with the results in large-scale network mapping and functional decoding analysis. Part of the human ability to comprehend syntax and syntactic processing, as well as overall language comprehension seems to be located in the IFG ( ). The STG is primarily responsible for processing sound and is also involved in processing the emotional meaning derived from facial expressions ( ). The auditory network, consisting of the IFG, STG, and adjacent insula, plays an important role in language and interaction with the environment ( ). However, there are limited reports on the relationships between acupuncture at ST36 and the auditory network, and the clinical applications of acupuncture in language disorders should be explored. \n\nThe activated regions also extend to bilateral insular areas that involve pain processing ( ). Interestingly, it has been reported that the insular/opercular area is one of the strongest activated regions in thermal stimulation and electrostimulation and positively responds to stimulation intensity during electrostimulation ( ,  ). The brain area associated with somatic nociception and central neuroendocrine system regulation is inhibited after acupuncture at ST36 ( ). Multiple limbic system regions, mid-inferior occipital gyrus, precentral gyrus, and postcentral gyrus with altered long-term simultaneous activities after ST36 acupuncture associated with sensation and pain, are found in the studies ( ,  ), which implies that the modes of action to the central nervous system for acupuncture analgesia may be time-dependent. Further research is needed to elucidate the short- and long-term mechanisms of acupuncture. \n\nThe MCG together with the parahippocampal gyrus are the important components of the limbic lobe with the functional of emotion processing and short- or long-term memory conversion ( ). However, the cluster in the MCG was unrobust in jackknife analysis after the removal of the results from the study of Napadow   et al  . ( ), which introduced EA stimulation at ST36. Although we did not identify significant heterogeneity among clusters, EA treatment could be a potential source of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses for MA and EA stimulation were performed separately. The results revealed that the extent of activation in brain regions after EA stimulation was much greater than that after MA stimulation, indicating that different neural mechanisms may underlie EA and MA during acupuncture. A study showed that electrical stimulation at other acupoints generated different activation patterns ( ), indicating that acupoint-specific activations may exist. However, Jin   et al  . ( ) blocked the local sensation with lidocaine infiltration subcutaneously in healthy subjects before MA, resulting in an attenuation of the activated regions without anesthesia, indicating that cutaneous sensation (  deqi   feelings) may be the major aspect of stimulation that generates brain activation. The effects of ST36 on gastrointestinal diseases have been frequently reported ( ,  ). One of the included studies showed that the oscillated secretion of gastric-related peripheral humoral factors is accompanied by hypothalamus activation in healthy subjects during EA stimulation ( ). However, the pooled results and the subgroup analysis results did not show hypothalamus activity alteration, which may be due to complex gut\u2013brain regulations that remained unclear. Additionally, subgroup analysis of control procedures revealed activation patterns similar to those following verum acupuncture. As the subgroup analysis results could not be directly compared, whether most of the acupuncture effect comes from electrical (or cutaneous) stimulations is still unknown. \n\nWe screened five studies reporting the intragroup comparison results of acupuncture vs. control for subgroup analysis to explore the ST36-specific activation of brain regions during acupuncture. The results showed that the activation of a small area located on the right supramarginal gyrus is specific to ST36 acupuncture. However, the findings conflict with the result that the regions that are specific to ST36 acupuncturing partially overlapped with the control stimulation pooled results. Moreover, based on the relationship between the group activations and the baseline, four activation modes can be observed in intragroup comparisons of task-based fMRI studies, namely, hyperactivations (treatment > control in task > baseline), hypo-activations (treatment < control in task > baseline), failures of deactivation (treatment < control in task < baseline), and hyperactivation (treatment > control in task < baseline) ( ,  ), but the studies included in the subgroup analysis provide no information on the accurate activation mode, and we simply regarded the results as hyperactivation and failures of deactivation in the subgroup analysis. Thus, the result should be interpreted with caution. \n\nAcupuncture treatment sessions generally take 5 to 40 min; hence, the relationship between needle retention time and brain activity is another important interest in the present work. Positive brain activation was found in the left olfactory cortex that positively correlated with needle retention time. Research has linked the association between acupuncture and olfactory regions. A canine model study has shown the left olfactory peduncle activation after postanesthesia acupuncture at BL60 (  Kunlun  ) ( ). Acupuncture at Li4 (  Hegu  ) and Li20 (  Yingxiang  ), as well as other acupoints, showed to improve olfactory sensitivity in healthy subjects ( ) and postinfectious smell loss patients ( ). Although olfactory dysfunction is one of the initial symptoms that appear years before motor symptoms and cognitive decline in several neurodegenerative diseases ( ,  ), studies have tested the activation effects of acupuncture at ST36 to the left olfactory cortex on Alzheimer's animal models ( ,  ), and clinical evidence on ST36 acupuncture effects in the olfactory cortex is still lacking. Our findings indicated that prolonged needle retention time during acupuncture at ST36 may strengthen the activation of the left olfactory cortex in healthy subjects, and thorough probe investigations into the clinical implications of this exploratory result may be required. \n\nThe mapping of acupuncture ST36-activated brain regions to a large-scale functional network atlas shows that most voxels map to auditory networks, the anterior salience network, and the posterior salience network, as well as the visuospatial network, language network, and dorsal DMN. The functional decoding results suggested that the activated regions were involved in pain, SII, electrical stimulation, auditory sensory and speech, and mood regulation. A study reported consistent results that acupuncture at ST36 produced the activation in the somatosensory area, insula, and the median cingulate cortex but deactivation in DMN areas ( ). You   et al  . ( ) reported alterations in DMN hub configurations following acupuncture at ST36. A meta-analysis of acupuncture for low back pain revealed that the brain regions involved in acupuncture were located in the salience network, DMN, pain matrix, and descending pain modulatory system ( ), demonstrating the analgesic effect of acupuncture. The DMN is associated with several advanced cognitive functions; the salience network mediates the switching between the DMN and the central executive network, and those three networks are theoretically the core \u201ctriple networks\u201d in cognition. The modulator interactions between the \u201ctriple networks\u201d following acupuncture at ST36 need further investigation. \n\nNotably, no SI area activation was observed in our pooled results, which may be inconsistent with some previous acupuncture fMRI results. Activations in SI have been reported in the included acupuncture studies ( ,  ). However, another included study demonstrated decreased activities in the SI and SII, which might be due to ST36 inhibited or modulated pain sensory for analgesic effects ( ). A recent study showed the activations in SI and SII, insula, and thalamus region during sponge scrubbing, whereas the SI region did show activation during real acupuncture at Li4 (Hegu) ( ). Another study reported evidence of functional diversity within SI that higher SI activation was found in the anticipation phase (a visual cue to inform participants that pain would be delivered) and lower activation in pain stimulation, indicating the differences in attentional and sensory pain processing ( ). In our results, SII activation was observed and agreed with the frequently reported results, indicating that acupuncture may involve complex sensory processing. Nonetheless, the somatosensory and analgesic mechanism for acupuncture at ST36 remains to be further researched. \n\nThe present study had the following limitations. First, the number of included studies and the total number of involved participants were relatively small. Second, the present meta-analysis did not study the effects of   deqi   sensations which are believed to be a key factor in the therapeutic effect of acupuncture. Although the acupuncture sensation scale ( ), the Massachusetts General Hospital acupuncture sensation scale ( ), and the Southampton needle sensation questionnaire ( ) were introduced and validated, inconsistencies in the evaluation of   deqi   sensations were found across the included studies, and it was difficult to precisely define the intensities of   deqi   sensations in the present meta-analysis. Universal tools for quantifying the   deqi   phenomenon may be of value in further research. Third, there is a relatively large publication year span of the included studies. Techniques and software have been substantially updated, which may introduce inestimable heterogeneity to the results. Forth, despite in most experimental paradigms, the needles were inserted into the skin before the scan and stayed in place throughout the scan session, the effects of the needle penetrating the skin were ignored. The needle retention time for the meta-regression was only considered as one stimulation period or plus the following non-resting state period but not the full length of the session. Specific experimental paradigms and analysis workflow considering for the nature of the acupuncture therapeutic effects may be needed in further studies. Fifth, the included studies tested different stimulations on the same subjects, and the design inevitably faces the concerns of selection bias and incomplete washout periods. A randomized controlled design with a larger sample size should be adopted in future research. Sixth, the MINORS scores of the included studies were below the recommended cutoff for comparison studies, suggesting methodological defects in the studies. However, considering the specialized designs, developing a new assessment tool for comprehensive methodological evaluation of task-based fMRI studies may be a solution. Finally, this study examined acupuncture-specific brain activation. Because of the relatively small sample size of included studies and unclarified mode of activation in the two-sample comparisons, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, acupuncture-specific brain activity is an important topic that warrants rigorous clinical studies and experimental validations. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nAcupuncture at ST36 in healthy individuals mainly activates three clusters located in the opercular part of IFG.R, STG.L, and MCG.R. EA stimulation may expand the activated brain regions. The needle retention time during an acupuncture session may enhance the activation of the left olfactory cortex. Our findings facilitate an understanding of the mechanisms of acupuncture treatment and provide neurological evidence for the clinical implications of acupuncture in analgesia, language processing, and mood disorders. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nHH, XY, and XH performed data analyses and wrote the main manuscript.

However, the available evidence on such deficits is inconsistent. To further illustrate the neurobiological underpinnings of anxiety disorder, the present meta-analysis summarizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings for cognitive reappraisal tasks and investigates related brain areas. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe performed a comprehensive series of meta-analyses of cognitive reappraisal fMRI studies contrasting patients with anxiety disorder with healthy control (HC) subjects, employing an anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping approach. We also conducted a subgroup analysis of medication status, anxiety disorder subtype, data-processing software, and MRI field strengths. Meta-regression was used to explore the effects of demographics and clinical characteristics. Eight studies, with 11 datasets including 219 patients with anxiety disorder and 227 HC, were identified. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared with HC, patients with anxiety disorder showed relatively decreased activation of the bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), bilateral parietal cortex, and left fusiform gyrus during cognitive reappraisal. The subgroup analysis, jackknife sensitivity analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and Egger\u2019s tests further confirmed these findings. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nImpaired cognitive reappraisal in anxiety disorder may be the consequence of hypo-activation of the prefrontoparietal network, consistent with insufficient top-down control. Our findings provide robust evidence that functional impairment in prefrontoparietal neuronal circuits may have a significant role in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorder. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAnxiety disorders are globally a very common and disabling group of mental disorders, ,  the cause of particularly high economic burden and clinically significant personal distress.  Many studies have sought to understand the neural basis of how pathological anxiety is triggered and maintained. Using emotion regulation questionnaires, psychological studies have indicated that anxiety disorders may entail impaired emotion regulation. ,  Models of anxiety have highlighted that impaired regulation of negative affectivity plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders, ,  explaining the onset and maintenance of anxiety. \n\nConsequently, a clear understanding of the neural systems underlying emotion dysregulation in anxiety disorders is important for identifying biological targets to improve the specificity and efficacy of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for anxiety disorder. \n\nEmotion regulation has been conceptualized as the process by which individuals modify the expression, experience, and physiology of their emotions.  According to models of emotion regulation, the most studied strategy is cognitive reappraisal, a type of antecedent-focused emotion regulation strategy that is achieved by altering one\u2019s interpretation or appraisal of affective events. ,  Cognitive reappraisal has been proven to be a high-efficiency way of regulating affect and physiological arousal,  costing less in terms of cognitive resource ,  compared with response-focused strategies (eg, expressive suppression) and having longer-lasting effects than attention-focused strategies (eg, distraction). ,  First-line intervention approaches to mental disorder (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy) are closely related to cognitive reappraisal.  Therefore, a better understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive reappraisal is crucial for translating basic and translational advances into clinical application. \n\nIn the past decades, the rapid growth of literature on fMRI neuroimaging studies has focused on neural correlates of cognitive reappraisal. , ,  A well-known behavior and fMRI study demonstrated that cognitive reappraisal resulted in prefrontal cortex responses and decreased negative emotion ratings in healthy control (HC).  Recently, three meta-analyses showed that implementing cognitive reappraisal consistently activates a large regulatory network, including the high activated dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), dmPFC, dACC, vmPFC, SMA, and inferior/superior parietal cortex, as well as the hypo-activated amygdala and insula, during emotion down-regulation. , , ,  This demonstrates that conscious cognitive reappraisal recruits a classic frontoparietal control network to modulate emotional responding in the amygdala. , ,  Although most previous cognitive reappraisal studies of healthy individuals describe a consistent neural regulatory network, whether and how these substrates differ in individuals with anxiety disorders remains poorly understood. \n\nRecent investigations have begun to fill in these gaps, finding that impaired cognitive reappraisal of emotion is observable across anxiety disorders.  Compared with healthy individuals, patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been found to show less consistent activation of the dmPFC and dACC when down-regulating negative images using reappraisal. \u2013  Elsewhere, a study of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) found less dlPFC activation in patients compared with HC during cognitive reappraisal.  Such findings show impaired top-down control of the prefrontal cortex during emotion regulation in patients with anxiety disorder. However, not all are entirely consistent. For example, one study using a similar task paradigm for SAD conversely showed increased activation of the dlPFC.  Furthermore, another recent study found no significant differences in frontoparietal activity during reappraisal between groups of SAD patients and healthy participants.  As this demonstrates, while there is some understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety disorders it has become increasingly difficult to aggregate and synthesize neuroimaging findings to reach conclusive agreement. Instead, further brain regions have been found to be associated with anxiety disorders (eg, the SMA and parietal cortex).  One the one hand, anxiety disorder is often accompanied by multiple psychological and physical symptoms whose neural mechanisms cannot be explained by abnormalities in a single brain region.  On the other, small and heterogeneous samples and substantial methodological differences between studies are likely to generate false positive results,  while consistent results obtained by independent studies from different research groups are relatively robust. A comprehensive quantitative analysis (meta-analysis) of the results of multiple studies to obtain convergent experimental evidence could therefore be hugely beneficial.  Hence, this study attempts to locate the core cognitive neuropsychology mechanisms that are specific to anxiety disorder, based on a meta-analysis of the extant literature. \n\nTo our knowledge, only one study has previously performed a meta-analysis of cognitive reappraisal fMRI studies in populations of patients with mood and anxiety disorders.  However, in that study, only four studies of patients with anxiety disorder were investigated. Other subtypes of anxiety disorder, such as GAD or panic disorder (PD), were not included. Thus, the findings cannot be generalized to other anxiety disorders. Moreover, major depressive disorders and anxiety disorders were combined in the sample of Pic\u00f3-P\u00e9rez et al.  Two recent reviews have shown major depressive disorders and anxiety disorders to have different disorder-specific deficits in the neural mechanisms of emotion regulation  involving cognitive reappraisal.  For example, a malfunction of the dlPFC is more predictive of and specific to depression disorder (relative to anxiety disorders) with an inability to down-regulate emotion reactions,  while reduced activity of the dACC is specific to anxiety disorders during down-regulation of negative emotion.  Further, other potentially influential factors, such as anxiety disorder subtype, data-processing software, and MRI field strengths, were not considered in the prior meta-analysis. Therefore, the core neural mechanisms of cognitive reappraisal underlying anxiety disorders remain unclear. Since further original cognitive reappraisal studies of anxiety disorders have been published in recent years, it is worthwhile performing an updated fMRI meta-analysis to investigate the abnormal brain activity underlying reappraisal and to explore other clinical profiles of alterations in brain function. \n\nThus, the goals of this study were threefold. First, we conducted a pooled meta-analysis to identify the most prominent and replicable brain regions of impaired cognitive reappraisal in patients with anxiety disorders. To do this we used anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) software \u2013 a newly developed meta-analytic method with increased specificity, sensitivity, and reliability of analyses \u2013 taking reported peak coordinates, statistical parametric maps, or both from original articles to reconstruct effect-size maps of the differences between patients and controls.  With this method, unlike other coordinate-based meta-analytic approaches such as ALE,  both positive and negative coordinates are recreated on the same map, which is a significant feature that prevents a particular voxel from erroneously appearing to be positive and negative at the same time.  Second, subgroup meta-analyses were conducted to explore the heterogeneity and robustness of the main results. Specifically, we performed subgroup meta-analyses to compare treatment-naive/medicine-free anxiety disorder patients with HC. A stratified meta-analysis of the subtype of anxiety disorders was subsequently conducted. We also conducted subgroup meta-analyses on data-processing software (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages [AFNI]) and MRI field strengths (3.0 T). Third, meta-regression analyses assessed the effects of gender and other relevant clinical profiles, such as age and comorbidity. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search strategies \n  \nA comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify functional magnetic resonance imaging literature on anxiety disorders, published before September 2017 and including \u201cin press\u201d articles. The search keywords were \u201cpanic disorder,\u201d \u201cagoraphobia,\u201d \u201cspecific phobia,\u201d \u201csocial phobia,\u201d \u201csocial anxiety disorder,\u201d \u201cSAD,\u201d \u201cposttraumatic stress disorder,\u201d \u201cpost-traumatic stress disorder,\u201d \u201cPTSD,\u201d \u201cobsessive compulsive disorder,\u201d \u201cobsessive-compulsive disorder,\u201d \u201cOCD,\u201d \u201cacute stress disorder,\u201d \u201cgeneralized anxiety disorder,\u201d \u201cgeneralized anxiety,\u201d \u201cGAD,\u201d and \u201canxiety,\u201d plus \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging,\u201d \u201cfMRI,\u201d and \u201cfunctional MRI,\u201d as well as \u201creappraisal\u201d and \u201ccognitive reappraisal.\u201d The reference lists of the identified trials and review articles were also manually checked to identify any other relevant papers. \n\n\n### Study eligibility criteria \n  \nWe considered studies that compared the blood oxygen level dependent responses of patients with anxiety disorder with those of HC, when performing a reappraisal task. In this kind of task, participants undergo fMRI during a cognitive reappraisal task that requires them to reappraise (ie, reduce) or maintain emotional responses to affective pictures (eg, a negative picture). The affective pictures come from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS)  or other databases. The contrasts of interest are the comparison of two conditions (reappraise and maintain) between clinical and healthy participants. Articles were included in the meta-analysis if they also met the following criteria: (1) patients in the studies had an anxiety disorder that met the criteria of the fourth edition of the   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders   (DSM-IV);  (2) the articles were published in a peer-reviewed journal; (3) whole-brain analyses were applied to both patients and HC; (4) the results of whole-brain analyses were reported; (5) significant thresholds for data were used that were corrected for multiple comparisons. The corresponding authors of the studies qualifying for inclusion were contacted by email for additional information. \n\nArticles were excluded if they met the following criteria: (1) anxiety disorder patients were not compared with HC; (2) they were conference abstracts or reviews; (3) they only reported region of interest results instead of whole-brain findings; (4) task activation analyses using the fMRI method were not used; (5) either the patient or HC group included \u226410 patients; and (6) where the same patient group was used in different publications, only the study with the largest sample was included. \n\n\n### Quality assessment and data extraction \n  \nWe performed the literature searches, reviewed the retrieved articles, and extracted and cross-checked data. All the studies included were quality-assessed using a 12-point checklist ( ) that focused on both the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study samples and the imaging-specific methodology used. This checklist was based on a prior meta-analytic study ,  that looked at structural MRI measures, but its critical variables are also significant for assessing task-based fMRI studies. Where inconsistent results were obtained, they were discussed and resolved by consensus review. For all studies entered into the meta-analysis, name of first author, publication year, basic demographic information (sample size, age, gender, and percentage of females), patient data (symptom severity, percentage of comorbidity, medication status), task stimulus material, data-processing method, MRI parameters, and three-dimensional coordinates, were extracted according to the AES-SDM method. \n\n\n### Voxel-wise meta-analysis \n  \nRegional differences in activation between patients and HC during fMRI tasks were identified in the selected studies using AES-SDM software in a standard process. Systematic whole-brain jackknife sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the robustness (specifically the sensitivity) of the results. Using this method, where a previously significant brain region remains significant in all or most of the combinations of studies, it can be concluded that the finding is highly replicable.  Recognizing the possible influence of medication status, subtype of anxiety disorder, and methodological differences between studies, we then performed several subgroup meta-analyses including medicine-naive patients, patients with SAD, patients with GAD and SAD, data processing software (AFNI), and MRI field strengths (3.0 T). Given the variability that exists in treatment status, we defined the sample of medicine-naive patients as participants who had been free of psychotropic medication for at least two months before the scan. \n\nAll the above analytical processes were performed on the selected studies using AES-SDM software, ,  which has previously been used with psychiatric patients ,  and is described in detail elsewhere. ,  Briefly, we used a relatively wide full-width at half-maximum (FWHM; 20 mm) to assign indicators of proximity to the reported three-dimensional coordinates, as this can optimally balance sensitivity and specificity in the AES-SDM.  We employed the standard threshold (  p  <0.005 with peak   Z  >1, extent threshold of clusters >10 voxels) as recommended by the AES-SDM software developers. This is proposed to optimally balance the sensitivity and specificity of results and to be an approximate equivalent to corrected   p  -value=0.05 (indeed 0.025) in AES-SDM for the effect-size used. This method showed adequate sensitivity and excellent control of false positive results (~2.5%) compared with other meta-analytical procedures.  Significant clusters obtained from AES-SDM analysis were overlaid on an MRIcron high-resolution brain template for display purposes.  Publication bias was assessed using Egger\u2019s test, as implemented in the AES-SDM software (version 5.141). \n\n\n### Heterogeneity and publication bias analysis \n  \nWe examined the statistical (between-studies) heterogeneity of clusters using a random effects model with Q statistics (chi-square distribution converted to z values and tested with both permutations,   p  <0.005, cluster extent=10 voxels). Moreover, the possibility of publication bias associated with brain regions activated differently during reappraisal between patients and HC was examined using Egger\u2019s test. \n\n\n### Meta-regression analysis \n  \nSome basic demographic and clinical information, such as the percentage of female patients, the percentage of comorbidity, sample size, mean age, race (white), and symptom severity (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self Rated and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) were entered into the regression analysis to investigate their association with regional differences in activation between patients and HC during cognitive reappraisal. The main output for each variable above was the map of the regression slope. As described in previous meta-analytic studies, we set a more conservative probability threshold (  p  <0.0005) in order to reduce detection of spurious relationships as much as possible. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included studies and sample characteristics \n  \nThe search strategy described in the methods section yielded a total of 47 studies. Of these, eight studies, , \u2013 , \u2013  with 11 relevant patients vs HC comparisons, ultimately met the inclusion criteria. In total they included 219 patients with anxiety disorder (70 GAD, 36 PD, 14 PTSD, 82 SAD, 17 comorbid SAD/GAD), and 227 HC. In eight studies, one study contained a down-regulate negative and positive affect,  other studies only included a down-regulate negative affect. One study  that found no significant differences between SAD patients and HC during a cognitive reappraisal task was also included \u2013 in this case we used a textfile named \u201cGaebler.no_peaks\u201d in order to report no activation peaks for a given contrast, as described in the meta-analysis tutorial. , ,  Patients with anxiety disorder and HC in the studies included were generally comparable in terms of age and gender. Regarding medication status, four studies with five relevant patients vs HC comparisons included patients undergoing treatment or who had undergone a \u201cwashout\u201d less than two months before the scan.   presents a flow diagram showing how we identified relevant studies.   summarizes the clinical and demographic data from all the enrolled studies. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis of functional brain abnormalities during reappraisal in anxiety disorder \n  \nThe results from the AES-SDM analysis are summarized in   and  . After correcting for multiple comparisons, compared with HC, patients with anxiety disorder showed significantly decreased activity during cognitive reappraisal in (1) the bilateral dmPFC (bilateral superior frontal gyrus, Brodmann area [BA] 9/32) and extending into the bilateral dACC (bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate, dorsal BA 24/32) and bilateral SMA (bilateral supplementary motor area, medial BA 6); (2) the left inferior parietal; (3) the right superior parietal gyrus; (4) the left amygdala; (5) the left fusiform gyrus; and (6) the left vmPFC (middle frontal gyrus, medial BA 11). Definitions of the dmPFC and dACC can be found in previous reviews. ,  However, we detected no significantly enhanced activity during reappraisal in patients with anxiety disorder compared with HC. \n\n\n### Jackknife sensitivity analysis \n  \nA whole-brain jackknife sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the replicability of the findings of the pooled meta-analysis. As shown in  , the results indicate that the decreased activation in the dmPFC, dACC, SMA and left inferior parietal was highly replicable, preserved as it was throughout all 11 combinations of studies. Results for the left amygdala, left fusiform gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus remained significant in all but one combination, while those for the right superior parietal gyrus were significant in all but two combinations. Detailed results are listed in  . \n\n\n### Subgroup meta-analyses \n  \nGiven the possible influence of medication status, subtype of anxiety disorder, and methodological differences between studies, several subgroup meta-analyses were performed. As shown in   and  , these analyses suggest that the above results remained largely unchanged. In the subgroup of studies using 3.0 T MRI (eight datasets), all clusters in the combined analysis remained significant except for the right superior parietal gyrus. In the subgroup of studies using AFNI software (seven datasets), all clusters in the combined analysis remained significant except for the left amygdala and left middle frontal gyrus. In the subgroup of medication-naive patients (six datasets), the clusters of the dmPFC, dACC, SMA, left inferior parietal, right superior parietal gyrus, and left fusiform gyrus remained significant. In the subgroup of SAD (five datasets), the clusters of the dmPFC, dACC, SMA, left amygdala, and right superior parietal gyrus remained significant. In the subgroup of both GAD and SAD (eight datasets), the clusters of the dmPFC, dACC, SMA, left inferior parietal, left amygdala, left fusiform gyrus and right superior parietal gyrus remained significant. \n\n\n### Heterogeneity analysis and publication bias \n  \nAn analysis of heterogeneity revealed that a few regions with altered activation (left amygdala, left fusiform gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus) showed significant statistical heterogeneity between studies (  p  <0.005). No strong evidence for publication bias was revealed by Egger\u2019s test (  p  >0.05), except for the left amygdala (  p  =0.006). \n\nAs the left amygdala was absent in two of the five subgroup analyses, and showed a significant heterogeneity and publication bias, we excluded it from the core brain region contributing to impaired cognitive reappraisal in anxiety disorders. \n\n\n### Meta-regression analyses \n  \nAs shown in  , the percentage of female patients had a positive relationship with activation in the right fusiform gyrus (Montreal Neurological Institute coordinate:   x  =20,   y  =\u221264,   z  =\u221212; AES-SDM value=2.369,   p  =0.000125587; 77 voxels). However, this result should be interpreted with caution as it is based on only three studies. Percentage of comorbidity, sample size, and mean age of patients with anxiety disorder were not associated with decreased brain regions. Race (white) and symptom severity (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self Rated and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) could not be explored because only six and five datasets respectively were available from the studies included. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe believe that this is the first study to independently explore regional neurofunctional activation and simultaneously investigate subgroup meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses in patients with anxiety disorder (including most subtypes) during cognitive reappraisal. First, the pooled meta-analysis identified significantly decreased activity during cognitive reappraisal in the bilateral dmPFC, bilateral dACC, bilateral SMA, bilateral parietal cortex, left vmPFC, and left fusiform gyrus in patients with anxiety disorder compared with HC. Second, subgroup analyses indicated that the above findings remained largely unchanged. The robustness of the main findings was further demonstrated by the jackknife sensitivity analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and Egger tests. Finally, meta-regression analysis showed that activation in the right fusiform gyrus was positively correlated with percentage of female patients. These findings suggest that impaired cognitive reappraisal in anxiety disorder may be the consequence of hypo-activation in the prefrontal cortex, dACC, and parietal cortex during emotion regulation, consistent with insufficient top-down control. \n\nThe most common finding of the current study was decreased activation in the bilateral dmPFC of patients with anxiety disorder during cognitive reappraisal. A large number of cognitive reappraisal studies have shown that healthy individuals can activate the dmPFC to achieve successful emotion regulation,  whereas here dmPFC activation was lower in patients with anxiety disorder during reappraisal. According to the results of cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire and behavioral research, anxiety disorder had impaired cognitive emotion regulation strategies involving cognitive reappraisal. ,  Neuroimaging studies have found that decreased dmPFC activity in anxiety disorder might be associated with reduced emotion regulation capability.  Furthermore, studies of healthy adults have found that activation in the dmPFC is associated with perceiving one\u2019s affective states ,  and self-related processing.  A previous meta-analysis examining large samples of healthy subjects in cognitive reappraisal studies has suggested that the dmPFC may support semantic and self-reflective processes relevant to elaborating the meaning of affective stimuli or drawing inferences about one\u2019s emotional state.  According to the findings discussed above, one possible explanation for the decreased dmPFC is that patients are unable to recruit the dmPFC to assist in monitoring and reflecting on the meaning of altering their affective states during reappraisal, and that this contributes to a reduced ability to down-regulate negative reactivity. Thus, insufficient recruitment of dmPFC activity could be an important neural correlate of emotion regulation deficits in anxiety disorder. \n\nComparing patients with anxiety disorder and HC during reappraisal revealed clusters of decreased activity in the dmPFC and extending into the dACC and SMA. The dACC lies on the medial surface of the frontal lobes and plays a significant role in regulating top-down cognitive control and assigning appropriate control to other areas of the brain. ,  The dACC has also been recognized as a key region of the emotion-regulation network, , ,  which is thought to mediate several functions including monitoring for conflict and detecting the likelihood of error commission, particularly involving attentional and executive control during the appraisal of negative emotion. , ,  Poor emotion regulation may involve impaired attention control. Theories based on cognitive and neuroscience research have indicated that deficient attentional control is associated with anxiety. ,  A previous review also found that anxiety disorder shows impaired recruitment of the dACC during emotion regulation.  Consequently, our findings suggest that anxiety disorder has a reduced ability to recruit the dACC implicated in top-down attention control to engage the emotion-regulation network. In addition, the SMA has also been consistently implicated as a core region of the emotion-regulation network in healthy people, and is associated with successful down-regulation of negative emotion. ,  During reconceptualization (changing an appraisal) the pre-SMA may reflect the execution of this reconceptualization by reformulating mental representations through language and memory processing, with the anterior and posterior cluster of the SMA related to cognitive and executive aspects of motor behavior.  Thus, an impaired SMA may reflect reduced recruitment of the executive and cognitive aspects at different stages, which contributed to emotion dysregulation in anxiety disorders. \n\nThe parietal cortex is one of the brain regions most commonly identified in fMRI studies of emotion regulation in anxiety disorders. ,  This brain region is a part of the frontoparietal control region  related to sensory information, with top-down response-related information to facilitate flexible, goal-directed behavior.  Meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies have indicated that the parietal cortex is mainly involved in selective attention and might assist in holding reappraisals in mind. ,  Compared with HC, patients with PTSD have a reduced ability to recruit the parietal cortex, implicated in top-down attentional control in the affective number Stroop task.  In one structural neuroimaging study, the SAD patients showed increased cortical thickness in the frontoparietal network, which fitted with findings at a functional level showing frontoparietal networks to be associated with executive-controlling and attentional functions.  Together, these results indicate that abnormalities in the parietal cortex may result in the dysfunction of top-down attentional control in anxiety disorder. \n\nAnother brain region showing abnormally reduced activity during appraisal was the left vmPFC. Because direct connections between the frontoparietal control region and amygdala associated with emotional response are relatively sparse compared with connections between vmPFC and the amygdala,  frontoparietal areas are likely to influence the amygdala indirectly by modulating activity in the vmPFC. ,  Based on animal and human research, vmPFC plays an important role in fear extinction and appraisal of negative emotion. ,  A prominent neurobiological model of the vmPFC highlights top-down inhibition of the amygdala through the vmPFC as a crucial neural mechanism that may be defective in certain mood and anxiety disorders.  Therefore, it might be speculated that patients with anxiety disorder cannot recruit the vmPFC through frontoparietal areas, in turn modulating the emotional response of the amygdala. \n\nBesides cognitive and attentional regions, the left fusiform gyrus was found to have decreased functional activation in anxiety disorder during reappraisal. The fusiform gyrus is associated with the perception of affective stimuli.  Commonly used emotion stimuli for probing neurobiological responses to cognitive reappraisal mainly come from the IAPS  and involve face stimuli.  During emotional face processing, healthy samples show greater neural activity in the fusiform gyrus,  while highly anxious individuals show impaired ability to process emotional faces.  Furthermore, SAD patients show significantly weaker activation in the left fusiform gyrus for emotional face perception, as compared with HC.  Emotion perception is a significant part of emotion regulation; meta-analytic connectivity modeling analysis has shown the bilateral fusiform gyrus to be involved in cognitive emotion regulation.  Thus, our findings suggest that an impaired fusiform gyrus may be an important neural correlate in anxiety disorders of cognitive emotion dysregulation. Notably, the meta-regression analysis identified a positive association between percentage of female patients and activation of the right fusiform gyrus. Female patients with anxiety disorder seem to have distinct neurobiological underpinnings compared with male patients.  A previous neuroimaging study reported that the fusiform gyrus showed increased activity in females with stress compared with males with stress, when perceiving emotional faces.  This result might reflect the fact that female patients with anxiety disorder have less difficulty recognizing and distinguishing emotions compared with male patients with anxiety disorder. \n\nHowever, heterogeneity analysis showed that there was significant, unexplained between-study variability concerning the left vmPFC and left fusiform gyrus. In our meta-analytic study, besides heterogeneity analysis, we also attempted to control the quality of the studies included by applying strict selection criteria and performing jackknife sensitivity analysis, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression analyses in order to reduce heterogeneity as much as possible. Although the left vmPFC and left fusiform gyrus showed significant heterogeneity, a quantitative assessment, as measured by Egger\u2019s test, was not significant. The jackknife sensitivity analysis further confirmed the robustness of the findings. Therefore, in our view, these two brain regions remain significant in our meta-analysis. \n\nInterestingly, while our meta-analytic study found an abnormal neural network contributing to impaired cognitive emotion regulation, an altered dlPFC, typically found in cognitive reappraisal, ,  was not found. The dlPFC has been proposed to play an important role in cognitive emotion regulation.  This brain area was cognitive control center is related to action inhibition, working memory, reasoning, and social cognition.  There are some explanations for the non-significant changes in the dlPFC in the present meta-analysis. First, although the dlPFC is a significant part of the frontoparietal control network, a flexible and superordinate system supporting adaptive behavioral control, ,  different brain regions of the frontoparietal network have shared and unique functions across a broad range of cognitive demands.  Normal activation in the dlPFC may not be affected because of help from other brain areas of the frontoparietal network. Behavior studies have shown that patients with anxiety disorder can successfully down-regulate their negative emotion, ,  which may be in line with the above putative mechanism by which the activity of the dlPFC is not affected. Second, although in their review Zilverstand et al  reported abnormal activity in the dlPFC in anxiety disorders, they did not conduct a meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive description of the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive emotion dysregulation. Furthermore, some of the articles in their review did not have sufficient statistical power. For example, the article reported decreased activity in the dlPFC in anxiety disorder compared with HC during reappraisal on the basis of a comparison of group differences, and no task effect or group \u00d7 task interactions were found in the prefrontal cortex. \n\nCompared with the study of Pic\u00f3-P\u00e9rez et al,  decreased activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and increased activation in insula, cerebellum, precentral and inferior occipital gyri were not observed in our study. These findings could be explained by two aspects. First, the vlPFC may support selection and inhibition of appropriate appraisals.  As a significant part of the limbic network, the insula is critically involved in the perception and encoding of aversive stimuli.  Previous systematic reviews suggested that dysfunction of lateral prefrontal cortex was predictive and specific to depression disorder  and major depressive patients could not recruit lateral prefrontal cortical region (ie, vlPFC) to attenuate activity in the limbic network during cognitive reappraisal.  In addition, relative to anxiety disorders, enhanced responses of limbic system during downregulation of emotion were specific findings to major depressive disorder.  Second, enhanced responses of limbic system contributed to excessive emotional processing and emotional experience, ,  the regions including cerebellum, precentral and inferior occipital gyri might be associated with the emotional experience.  Therefore, these regions that were not observed in our study might reflect specific deficits of major depressive disorder in neural mechanisms of emotion regulation. These findings could be useful in distinguishing anxiety disorder from major depression. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThere are several limitations to our study that should be highlighted. First, the number of fMRI studies included was small; the literature search yielded only eight studies with 11 relevant patients vs controls comparisons. This could affect the generalizability of our results, particularly in the subgroup meta-analyses and meta-regressions analyses. Second, our meta-analysis was based on coordinates from published studies rather than raw statistical maps, which might reduce its accuracy.  Third, the heterogeneity of the data acquisition and analysis techniques, including MRI field strengths, slice thickness, voxel size, and data-processing software, may reduce the accuracy of these results. Fourth, our meta-analysis included studies of medicine-naive patients who had undergone a medication washout period before scanning, so that longer-term influences of medication on brain function could not be completely excluded. Although we conducted a subgroup meta-analysis of the medicine-naive, these results should be interpreted with caution. Finally, some patients with anxiety disorder had co-morbid major depression. Anxiety and major depressive disorders may have different disorder-specific deficits in the neural mechanisms of cognitive reappraisal. ,  Although the patients fulfilled our criteria for comorbid-major depression with anxiety disorder being the primary diagnosis, the influence of major depression cannot be completely ruled out. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, we identified the most robust functional neuroimaging findings on cognitive reappraisal in anxiety disorder. The results demonstrated that patients with anxiety disorder could not recruit the prefrontoparietal network, including the dmPFC, dACC, SMA, vmPFC, and parietal cortex, to down-regulate their emotion response. Our findings provide robust evidence that impairment of prefrontoparietal neuronal circuits may play an important role in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorder. This finding may provide novel targets for medical or cognitive-behavioral interventions and neuromodulation approaches (eg, transcranial magnetic stimulation). With longitudinal data, future investigations should further explore whether these functional abnormities are associated with structural changes or influenced by disease severity and medication status. \n\n\n## Supplementary materials \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5953307, "text_md5": "2e4ff0604778fd1fa5ce61a4a42ac3b1", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 150], "journal": [151, 175], "publication_year": [177, 181], "title": [192, 333], "keywords": [347, 464], "abstract": [477, 2439], "body": [2448, 38494]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 29785110, "doi": "10.2147/NDT.S165677", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953307", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5953307"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5953307\">5953307</a>", "list_title": "PMC5953307  Prefrontoparietal dysfunction during emotion regulation in anxiety disorder: a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies"}

Compared to non-small cell lung cancer, less data are available about the impact of molecular imaging using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( F-FDG PET/CT) in staging patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to provide quantitative data about the impact of  F-FDG PET/CT in staging SCLC. \n\n Methods:   A comprehensive literature search of studies on the use of  F-FDG PET/CT in patients with SCLC was performed. Three different databases were screened (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases) until June 2019. Only articles describing the impact of  F-FDG PET/CT in staging patients with SCLC were selected. A pooled analysis evaluating the change of binary SCLC staging (limited-stage vs. extensive-stage disease) using  F-FDG PET/CT was carried out. \n\n Results:   Nine articles including 721 patients with SCLC were included in the systematic review. Compared to conventional staging, a superior diagnostic accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT was found. A change of binary SCLC staging using  F-FDG PET/CT was demonstrated in 15% (95% confidence interval, 9\u201321%) of patients with SCLC. Currently, it is not clearly demonstrated that the use of  F-FDG PET/CT for staging may improve the survival outcome of patients with SCLC. \n\n Conclusions:  F-FDG PET/CT is a useful molecular imaging method for staging patients with SCLC because it can change the management in a significant number of patients. More large prospective studies and cost-effectiveness analyses on the impact of  F-FDG PET/CT in staging patients with SCLC are needed. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nNeuroendocrine tumors are ~20% of all lung cancers, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most frequent neuroendocrine tumor of the lung. Most cases of SCLC are related to smoking, and the estimated incidence of this tumor in the United States for the year 2019 is 29,660 new cases/year with a male/female incidence ratio of 1:1 ( ,  ). \n\nSCLC is an aggressive high-grade neuroendocrine tumor characterized by rapid growth and early development of metastatic spread. Most SCLC patients have metastatic disease at the initial diagnosis, and about one-third of them has limited disease confined to the chest, whereas two-thirds of them has hematogenous metastases. Even if SCLC is usually highly sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, however, most patients develop recurrent disease ( ,  ). \n\nMost of the literature classifies SCLC patients based on a binary classification scheme to define the extent of the disease. Limited-stage disease (LD-SCLC) is confined to the ipsilateral hemithorax (including contralateral mediastinal and ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodal metastases) and can be included within a radiation field. Extensive-stage disease (ED-SCLC) is spread beyond the ipsilateral hemithorax (including hematogenous metastases and malignant pleural or pericardial effusion) ( \u2013 ). In patients with LD-SCLC, the standard treatment is usually chemotherapy plus thoracic radiation therapy. In this setting of patients, prophylactic cranial irradiation is also indicated to increase overall survival. In ED-SCLC, long-term survival is rare, and systemic therapy alone is considered a palliative treatment ( \u2013 ). Correct staging of SCLC is pivotal to assess the indication of thoracic radiation therapy, which is useful mainly in patients with LD-SCLC. Therefore, using a binary staging system in SCLC patients, only disagreement on the presence or absence of metastatic lesions outside one hemithorax or malignant pleural effusion will have a significant impact on patient management ( ). \n\nComputed tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most used imaging methods for staging SCLC ( ). However, if LD-SCLC is suspected, molecular imaging using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( F-FDG PET) can be performed to assess for distant metastases. In particular, hybrid imaging using  F-FDG PET/CT, providing both functional and morphological data, has been demonstrated to be superior to  F-FDG PET alone, and it is the current state of art for molecular imaging of lung cancer ( ). As SCLC is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor with increased metabolism and  F-FDG is a radiolabeled glucose analog, an increased uptake of this radiopharmaceutical is expected by SCLC lesions ( \u2013 ). Compared to non-small cell lung cancer, less data are available about the impact of molecular imaging using  F-FDG PET/CT in staging patients with SCLC. Therefore, we aimed to provide timely evidence-based data on the use of this imaging method for staging SCLC. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis evidence-based article was written according to the \u201cPreferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies\u201d ( \u2013 ). This review has been registered on the online database PROSPERO (international prospective register of systematic reviews) after submission, as requested by the reviewers. \n\n### Review Question and Patient/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome Process \n  \nThe review question was formulated according to the Patient/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome process: \n  \n- Patients: individuals with histologically proven SCLC; \n  \n- Intervention:  F-FDG PET/CT performed for disease staging; \n  \n- Comparison: staging without  F-FDG PET/CT (e.g., using conventional imaging methods such as contrast-enhanced CT or bone scintigraphy); \n  \n- Outcomes: the main outcome was the change of binary SCLC staging using  F-FDG PET/CT; secondary outcomes were the diagnostic accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT staging compared to conventional staging in SCLC and the impact of  F-FDG PET/CT staging on survival of SCLC patients. \n  \n\n### Search Strategy \n  \nTwo authors (FM and GT) performed a comprehensive computer literature search of three different bibliographic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library) to find published articles on the impact of  F-FDG PET/CT in staging patients with SCLC. A search algorithm combining several keywords related to the index test and the target condition was used: (A) \u201cSCLC\u201d and (B) \u201cPET/CT\u201d or \u201cPET-CT.\u201d No beginning date limit nor language restrictions were used. The literature search was performed until June 30th, 2019. To expand the literature search, we also screened the references of the retrieved articles searching for additional studies, which could be included in the systematic review. \n\n\n### Study Selection \n  \nInclusion criteria were studies or subsets of studies investigating the impact of  F-FDG PET/CT in staging patients with SCLC histologically proved. The exclusion criteria were (a) articles outside the field of interest of this review (including articles using  F-FDG PET only without hybrid technology for staging, studies evaluating the prognostic value of  F-FDG PET/CT or its use for radiotherapy planning, and articles evaluating the role of  F-FDG PET/CT for treatment response assessment or restaging after treatment); (b) review articles, letters, comments, editorials, and conference proceedings; and (c) case reports or small case series. \n\nTwo researchers (FM and GT) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned above. The same two researchers then independently reviewed the full text of the selected articles to assess their eligibility for inclusion. In cases of studies performing both  F-FDG PET and PET/CT, whether sufficient information on the findings of the subgroup performing  F-FDG PET/CT were not provided, we have excluded them from the qualitative analysis. A consensus meeting among the researchers was performed to solve any disagreement. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nFor each study included in the qualitative analysis, we collected the following information: authors, year of publication, country of origin, study design and level of evidence, patient characteristics (overall number of SCLC patients performing  F-FDG PET/CT, mean age, sex ratio), technical aspects (hybrid imaging modality, injected radiopharmaceutical activity, time interval between radiopharmaceutical injection and image acquisition, image analysis, comparison with other imaging methods), diagnostic accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT for staging compared to conventional imaging (on a patient-based analysis), percentage of change of binary SCLC staging (from LD-SCLC to ED-SCLC and vice versa) using  F-FDG PET/CT, and impact of  F-FDG PET/CT on the survival outcome of SCLC patients. \n\n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nThe overall quality of the studies included in the systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using the revised \u201cQuality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies\u201d tool ( ). \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nThe change of binary SCLC staging by  F-FDG PET/CT was defined as the ratio between the number of SCLC patients with a change of staging obtained by  F-FDG PET/CT (upstaging from LD-SCLC to ED-SCLC or downstaging from ED-SCLC to LD-SCLC, respectively) and the overall number of SCLC patients who underwent the  F-FDG PET/CT scan. Pooled analyses were performed using a random-effects model (taking into account the variability between studies). Pooled data were presented with their respective 95% confidence interval (95% CI) values and displayed using forest plots. Heterogeneity was estimated using the   I  -square index (  I  ) ( ). Publication bias was assessed through the Egger's test ( ). StatsDirect software version 3 (StatsDirect Ltd., Cambridge, UK) was used for the meta-analysis. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Literature Search \n  \nThe results of the literature search are reported in  . The comprehensive computer literature search revealed 165 articles. Reviewing titles and abstracts, 152 records were excluded: 136 because they were outside the field of interest of this systematic review; 10 as reviews, comments, editorials, or letters; and 6 as case reports. Thirteen articles were selected, and their full text was retrieved ( \u2013 ). No additional records were found screening the reference list of the retrieved articles. Four articles were excluded from the analysis because both  F-FDG PET and PET/CT were performed, but sufficient information about the findings of the  F-FDG PET/CT subgroup were not provided ( \u2013 ). Finally, nine articles including 791 patients who underwent  F-FDG PET/CT were eligible for the systematic review ( \u2013 ). Six articles about change of binary SCLC staging using  F-FDG PET/CT in 277 patients were included in the meta-analysis ( ,  \u2013 ,  ,  ). The characteristics of the included studies are presented in  \u2013 .

The included studies were published from 2007 to 2019. Patients from several countries and different continents were represented. One-third of the studies were prospective, and most of them were single-center studies (89%). The median age of the SCLC patients ranged from 58 to 69.6 years. The percentage of male patients widely ranged from 22 to 90%. \n\n\n#### Technical Aspects \n  \nThe technical aspects about  F-FDG PET/CT were heterogeneous ( ). The hybrid imaging modality was PET/CT using low-dose CT in most of the cases and contrast-enhanced CT in 22% of the studies. Mean injected radiotracer activity were quite different among the included studies. The mean time between radiopharmaceutical injection and image acquisition was 60 min. The analysis of PET images was carried out using visual/qualitative analysis in all studies. In some studies, a further analysis using the calculation of semiquantitative parameters, for instance the maximal standardized uptake value (SUV ), was performed. A composite reference standard including histology, further imaging, or clinical/biochemical follow-up was used in the included studies.  F-FDG PET/CT findings were compared with CT or bone scintigraphy findings in most of the articles. \n\n\n#### Main Findings \n  \nThree studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT staging compared to conventional staging without  F-FDG PET/CT in patients with SCLC ( ,  ,  ). \n\nIn the prospective study of Fischer et al., the diagnostic performance of  F-FDG PET/CT in correctly staging LD-SCLC and ED-SCLC was 95% (19 out of 20 SCLC correctly staged), and it was higher compared to that of conventional imaging methods (85%; 17 out of 20 patients correctly staged) ( ). The better diagnostic performance of  F-FDG PET/CT in correctly staging LD-SCLC and ED-SCLC was also confirmed by another prospective study of Kishida et al. who found a diagnostic accuracy of 96.6% (57/59 patients correctly staged as ED-SCLC or LD-SCLC) for  F-FDG PET/CT compared to 91.5% (54/59 patients correctly staged as ED-SCLC or LD-SCLC) for conventional staging, even if this difference was not statistically significant ( ). \n\nSix studies assessed the change of binary SCLC staging using  F-FDG PET/CT compared to conventional staging (upstaging from LD-SCLC to ED-SCLC or downstaging from ED-SCLC to LD-SCLC, respectively) reporting percentages ranging from 5.1 to 21.7% ( \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nAbout the comparison among  F-FDG PET/CT and bone scintigraphy for SCLC staging, the study of Lee et al. demonstrated that, in patients with SCLC,  F-FDG PET/CT showed higher detection rate of bone metastases than bone scintigraphy. In 95 SCLC performing both methods for detecting bone metastases, the sensitivity of  F-FDG PET/CT was 100 and 87% on a per-patient- and on a per-lesion-based analysis, respectively; conversely, the sensitivity of bone scintigraphy was 37 and 29% on a per-patient- and on a per-lesion-based analysis, respectively. Based on these findings,  F-FDG PET/CT should replace bone scintigraphy for staging SCLC ( ). \n\nOn the other hand, for detecting brain metastases of SCLC,  F-FDG PET/CT cannot substitute brain MRI due to the limited detection rate of brain metastases by  F-FDG PET/CT ( ); the main concern about the use of  F-FDG PET for evaluating brain lesions is the high background  F-FDG uptake in normal brain. \n\nAbout the impact of  F-FDG PET/CT staging on outcome of SCLC patients, the survival outcomes were similar in patients staged with or without  F-FDG PET/CT, according to the recently published analysis of the CONVERT randomized controlled trial; however, this analysis cannot support the omission of  F-FDG PET/CT for SCLC staging due to some study limitations, as reported by the authors ( ). \n\nXanthopoulos et al. found that LD-SCLC patients staged with  F-FDG PET/CT exhibited improved disease control and survival when compared with LD-SCLC patients staged without  F-FDG PET/CT. The median overall survival from diagnosis in patients staged with  F-FDG PET/CT was 32 vs. 17 months in patients staged without PET/CT (  p   = 0.03), and 3-year survival was 47 vs. 19%, respectively. Median time-to-distant failure was 29 vs. 12 months, respectively (  p   = 0.04); median time-to-local failure was not reached vs. 16 months, respectively (  p   = 0.04). On multivariable analysis,  F-FDG PET/CT staging was associated with survival (odds ratio = 0.24;   p   = 0.04) ( ). \n\n\n\n### Quantitative Analysis (Meta-Analysis) \n  \nSix studies (277 SCLC patients) were selected for the meta-analysis on the change of binary SCLC staging using  F-FDG PET/CT ( \u2013 ,  ,  ,  ). The pooled percentage of change of binary SCLC stage using  F-FDG PET/CT (upstaging from LD-SCLC to ED-SCLC or downstaging from ED-SCLC to LD-SCLC, respectively) was 15% (95% CI, 9\u201321%) ( ). A moderate heterogeneity among the included studies was found (  I   = 50%). The Egger's test did not demonstrate a significant publication bias (  p   = 0.08). \n  \nPlots of individual studies and pooled percentage of change of binary small cell lung cancer (SCLC) stage using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( F-FDG PET/CT), including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The size of the squares indicates the weight of each study. \n  \nPerforming a subgroup analysis based on the different type of study design, the percentage of change of binary SCLC staging using  F-FDG PET/CT in prospective and retrospective studies was 11% and (95% CI, 2\u201325%) and 17% (95% CI, 12\u201323%), respectively. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis is the first meta-analysis focused on the impact of hybrid  F-FDG PET/CT for staging of SCLC patients. In fact, previous published evidence-based documents included mostly articles about the use of  F-FDG PET only in staging SCLC ( \u2013 ). As the current state of the art of PET imaging in oncology is hybrid  F-FDG PET/CT, we have provided timely and updated information selecting only articles that have evaluated the impact of SCLC staging using this hybrid imaging modality. \n\nSeveral studies have used  F-FDG PET/CT for staging SCLC patients; however, most of these studies have limited statistical power, due to their relatively small patient population. We have pooled data from the published studies to provide more robust estimates on the impact of  F-FDG PET/CT for staging SCLC patients. \n\nThe most relevant information provided by our systematic review and meta-analysis is that  F-FDG PET/CT has an impact in staging SCLC patients, as this method may change the binary SCLC stage (from LD-SCLC to ED-SCLC or vice versa) in ~15% of patients. This change of binary SCLC stage automatically leads to a change of therapeutic management, as only LD-SCLC may have benefit of a radiation therapy for curative intent ( ). \n\nThe change of binary SCLC stage may be related to the better diagnostic accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT compared to conventional imaging methods in detecting SCLC metastases in different organs (except for brain metastases), as functional abnormalities detected by  F-FDG PET usually precede morphological alterations revealed by conventional imaging methods ( ). To this regard, in a previous meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR+ and LR\u2013) of  F-FDG PET or PET/CT in diagnosing ED-SCLC were 97.5% (95%CI, 94.2\u201399.2%), 98.2% (95% CI, 94.9\u201399.6%), 19.86 (95% CI, 9.79\u201340.3), and 0.06 (95% CI, 0.03\u20130.1), respectively ( ). There were no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy between  F-FDG PET/CT and PET alone in the detection of ED-SCLC, but limited data about  F-FDG PET/CT were available ( ). \n\nCurrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines suggest to perform  F-FDG PET/CT for staging SCLC only if LD-SCLC is suspected ( ). Furthermore, the American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria recommend the use of  F-FDG PET/CT in patients with suspicious LD-SCLC being considered for treatment with curative intent, whereas the use of  F-FDG PET/CT for further staging is considered optional if ED-SCLC is established ( ). Evidence-based data provided by our meta-analysis strengthen the current recommendations on the use of  F-FDG PET/CT for staging SCLC patients. \n\nSome limitations of our analysis should be underlined. The first limitation is the low number of included studies on the impact of  F-FDG PET/CT in staging SCLC. Another limitation is the heterogeneity among the included studies likely based on differences of patient characteristics, methodological aspects, and study quality. Conversely, we did not detect a significant publication bias in our meta-analysis. \n\nBased on the data reported in our systematic review, we would like to suggest to perform more large multicentric and prospective studies on the impact of  F-FDG PET/CT for SCLC staging to strengthen its role in this setting. \n\nFurthermore, more prospective studies to clarify the impact of  F-FDG PET/CT staging on the survival outcomes of SCLC patients would be useful to support its routine clinical use for SCLC staging. Unfortunately, the available data to this regard are not univocal ( ,  ). The major advantages of  F-FDG PET/CT staging in SCLC may lie in avoiding unnecessary toxicity in ED-SCLC and in suggesting the appropriate addition of thoracic radiation therapy in LD-SCLC with potential better patient survival ( ). It has been recently demonstrated by a retrospective study in a mixed SCLC patient population performing both  F-FDG PET and PET/CT that  F-FDG PET staging in patients with SCLC was associated with greater overall survival and lung-cancer-specific survival, likely reflecting stage migration and stage-appropriate therapy ( ). \n\nLastly, cost-effectiveness analyses on the use of  F-FDG PET/CT in staging SCLC are currently lacking in the literature. One article performed a cost analysis in a European setting, taking into account the overall costs of staging and therapy of SCLC, using two different strategies for staging (staging with  F-FDG PET/CT compared to conventional staging without  F-FDG PET/CT), reporting a non-significant difference in overall costs among these strategies ( ). Another cost analysis in an Australian setting demonstrated that the initial costs of the two staging strategies, with or without  F-FDG PET/CT, were not significantly different.  F-FDG PET/CT staging may reduce healthcare costs for SCLC patients through avoidance of inappropriate thoracic radiation therapy ( ). \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nF-FDG PET/CT is a very useful imaging method in staging SCLC patients, as it may change the binary SCLC stage, resulting in change of therapeutic management, in ~15% of cases. Further well-designed studies on the use of this hybrid imaging method for SCLC staging are needed. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nAll authors contributed to the manuscript.

This study analyzes the extant literature on the neuronal effects of exercise on inhibitory control functions. We searched four online databases (Pubmed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) for relevant peer-reviewed studies to identify eligible studies published before September 1, 2021. Among the 4,090 candidate studies identified, 14 meet the inclusion criteria, and the results of 397 participants in these 14 studies are subsequently analyzed. We quantify the neural effects on the entire brain by using GingerALE software and identify 10 clusters of exercise-induced neuronal with either increases/decreases in the superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), precuneus (BA 7), superior frontal gyrus (BA 10), cuneus (BA 19), precuneus (BA 19), caudate, posterior cingulate (BA 19), middle temporal gyrus (B 37), parahippocampal gyrus (BA 30), precentral gyrus (BA 6). Meta-analytic coactivation map (MACM) showed that multiple functional networks overlap with brain regions with activation likelihood estimation (ALE) results. We propose the effect of exercise on neural activity is related to inhibitory control in the extended frontoparietal, default mode network (DMN), visual network, and other pathways. These results provide preliminary evidence of the neural effects of exercise on inhibitory control. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInhibitory control or inhibition is defined as suppressing prepotent responses to goal-irrelevant stimuli and contributes to anticipation, planning, and goal setting. Inhibitory control is one of the three core executive functions of the brain (Aron,  ; Liang et al.,  ). People who suffer from impaired inhibitory control have a lower quality of life and develop health problems and diseases which applies to healthy and sick people (Liang et al.,  ). Meanwhile, impaired inhibitory control could be a hallmark feature of several neuropsychological DSM-5 disorders including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Crosbie et al.,  ; Bari and Robbins,  ), bipolar disorder (Hidiroglu et al.,  ), schizophrenia (Enticott et al.,  ; Hughes et al.,  ), and substance use disorders (Liao et al.,  ; Lee et al.,  ). Although the disorders listed here are primarily characterized by difficulties in controlling behavior (Brady et al.,  ; Sofuoglu et al.,  ; Baumeister et al.,  ), they are also found in normal cognitive aging (Coxon et al.,  ; Smittenaar et al.,  ). Thus, to understand the risk of developing these disorders and contribute to current prevention and treatment measures, an analysis of the neural underpinnings of inhibitory control is essential and timely. \n\nPhysical activity has garnered significant attention as a potentially effective method for elevating cognitive function and improving brain health throughout life (Loprinzi et al.,  ; Ji et al.,  ). Meta-analyses of healthy participants (Li et al.,  ; Amatriain-Fernandez et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD; Liang et al.,  ), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; Biazus-Sehn et al.,  ) as well as ADHD patients (Liang et al.,  ) have shown that exercise has a positive effect on inhibitory control in individuals. Neuroimaging studies have also demonstrated the inhibitory control mechanisms of the brain by exploring the relationship between exercise and brain region activation during specific tasks (e.g., flanker, go/no-go, and Stroop tasks). Previous studies reported that the \u201ccognitive control network\u201d actively coordinates multiple brain regions, such as the frontal cortex (including the anterior cingulate cortex), parietal cortex, motor regions, and cerebellum (Niendam et al.,  ; Akatsuka et al.,  ; Chu et al.,  ). The effects of exercise on functional changes in inhibitory control are not apparent. Indeed, some studies report an increase in the activation of the prefrontal and parietal lobes following exercise intervention (Mehren et al.,  ), whereas others reported less activation in the frontal and temporal lobes during similar inhibitory-based tasks (Krafft et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ). \n\nThe last few years have seen the introduction of several tools for performing a meta-analysis of data obtained from brain imaging research, allowing for the quantitative integration of findings from different studies. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) is a relatively way to estimate the probability that at least one activation focus from a set of experiments lies at the location of a specific voxel, using Gaussian assumptions of spatial uncertainty (Turkeltaub et al.,  ) This study, using the ALE method, aimed to explore the overall neural changes in inhibitory control associated with exercise. We hypothesized the critical regions of exercise-induced inhibitory control are related to several frontal and parietal cortex brain areas. To validate ALE results whether overlap the brain networks to related frontoparietal or other brain networks, we applied a meta-analytic co-activation model (MACM) approach using activation clusters as regions of interest (ROIs) from our ALE results. \n\n\n## Method \n  \nThe meta-analysis in this study is completed and reported by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement (PRISMA). The protocol was registered as trial registration number CRD42021285736 under the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). \n\n### Search Strategy \n  \nFour electronic databases (Pubmed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) were searched from their inception to September 1, 2021, to identify all published studies on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that investigate the impact of exercise on the activation of different brain areas during inhibitory control tasks. The initial search used three key terms: physical activity or exercise, inhibitory control, and fMRI. We also hand-searched recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses to identify potential studies (Liang et al.,  ; Yu et al.,  ). The search was limited to English-language results and human subjects. The reference lists of included studies were manually reviewed for relevant articles that were captured through the database searches. The detailed keyword search strategy is presented in the  . \n\n\n### Study Selection \n  \nThe screening for relevant studies was conducted in accordance with the PICOS (participants, intervention, comparisons, outcomes, and study design) principles. The participants included individuals of all ages and pathologies. The studies must have investigated the effect of exercise on inhibitory control and examined pre/post-intervention with at least one group assigned to physical activity/exercise intervention. During fMRI scanning, studies must have assessed brain activation patterns   via   completed inhibitory control tasks (e.g., go/no-go, stroop, flanker, or Simon tasks). For inclusion, retrievable data in standard Talairach or Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space was also required. Finally, the chosen studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trial studies (NRCTs) published in peer-reviewed journals. \n\nTwo reviewers independently conducted the multi-step search process based on these selection criteria and screened the studies based on their title and abstract. Full-length texts were eventually used to identify eligible articles. If consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer made the final decision after discussion with the two reviewers. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nA standardized data extraction form was developed to extract relevant data from each study, including the bibliographic details (author and year), participant characteristics (sample size, sex, and age range), intervention components (intervention design and duration), fMRI task, software used, and active results/foci. \n\n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nThe Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale, a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the methodological quality of studies that focus on the effects of physical activity on cognitive functions, was used to determine the methodological quality (Sherrington et al.,  ). This scale includes 11 rating criteria including eligibility, randomization, allocation, blinding (subjects and experimenter), intention-to-treat, between-group comparison, and point measures. The methodological criteria were scored as Yes (one point), No (zero points) or Do not know (zero points). The PEDro score of each selected study served as an indicator of the methodological quality (<4 = poor; 4\u20135 = fair; 6\u20138 = good; and 9\u201310 = excellent). \n\nThe fMRI quality was determined from a set of guidelines for the standardized reporting of the fMRI studies and used to assess the fMRI study design/reporting quality and quality of the fMRI data of each included study (Poldrack et al.,  ). The fMRI form has 8-item rating criteria for eligibility, the experimental design, handedness and gender of participants, explanation for rejected data, details of the imaging parameters, software analysis method and package used, motion correction method during pre-processing, multiple comparison correction, and detailed description of the first and second level analyses. \n\n\n### Data Analysis \n  \nThe ALE is a reliable quantitative method for coordinate-based meta-analyses to identify brain activation during cognitive functions after exercise (Laird et al.,  ). In this study, GingerALE v2.3.6 ( ) software is used to analyze the data. A statistical threshold of uncorrected   p   < 0.001 and a minimum cluster size of 100 mm  were used (Meng et al.,  ). The ALE maps were imported into Mango Version 4.1 ( ) software and overlaid on an anatomical template in MNI space for visualization. The effect of exercise on behavioral performance is not examined due to missing data and changes in an inhibitory control task that resulted in the effect magnitude being inestimable. \n\nAdditionally, to obtain the MACM based on the ALE results, we followed the procedure proposed by Robinson et al. ( ) as implemented in NeuroSynth ( ; Yarkoni et al.,  ). The activation clusters as seed ROIs were separately entered into NeuroSynth to evaluate the MACM. In brief, the software searches among more than 11,000 fMRI studies (totaling 413,429 activations in the MNI152 coordinate space) those reporting activation in a spherical seed (6 mm) around the searched coordinates. The identified co-activations are then pooled together to form the MACM output that is corrected for multiple comparisons (  p   < 0.01 false discovery rate; FDR as provided in NeuroSynth). Namely, a z-score is assigned to each voxel, representing the strength of the association between a given voxel and the seed coordinates. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study Selection \n  \nFour thousand and eighty-eight studies were identified from the four databases, and two studies were identified from other systemic reviews. Included studies were chosen after thoroughly screening the titles, abstracts, and full text. Fourteen studies were identified for the meta-analysis ( ). \n  \nPRISMA flow diagram of selected studies. Multi-step search process shows the number of studies screened and those that meet the inclusion criteria. \n  \n\n### Study Characteristics \n  \n lists the characteristics of the 14 studies that involved 397 participants. Six studies (Mehren et al.,  , , ; Won et al.,  ; Cui et al.,  ; Meng et al.,  ) utilized acute exercise paradigms and eight studies (Colcombe et al.,  ; Liu-Ambrose et al.,  ; Krafft et al.,  ; Sachs et al.,  ; Hsu et al.,  ; Martinsen et al.,  ; Pensel et al.,  ; Wu et al.,  ) utilized chronic exercise routines. Three neurocognitive tasks (including flanker, stroop, and go/no-go tasks) were used to assess inhibitory control in participants across the studies. \n  \nDescriptive characteristics of included studies. \n  \n RCT, randomized control trial; nRCT, non-randomized control trial; SIVCI, subcortical ischemic vascular cognitive impairment; ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; BAT, twice-weekly balance and tone training; RT1, once-weekly resistance training; RT2, twice-weekly resistance training; HT, high-fit group; LF, low-fit group; MI, moderate intensity; HI, high intensity; HITT, high-intensity interval training  . \n  \n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \n shows the methodological quality of the studies using the PEDro scale. The total scores range from 6 to 9 (  M   = 6.71). Notably, none of the studies reported blinded data due to the difficulties of using blinded subjects, therapists, and assessors in an exercise intervention. The studies that failed to obtain points in other criteria due to their study design include lack of eligibility (  n   = 1), random allocation (  n   = 9), and concealed allocation (  n   = 10). \n  \nMethodological quality assessment of included studies. \n  \n Yes = 1; No or Do not know = 0  . \n  \n shows the fMRI quality assessment for all of the studies from a set of guidelines for the standardized reporting of fMRI studies. Other criteria were lacking in at least one reporting guideline, particularly in the scan rejection mentioned (  n   = 13), scan rejection reason (  n   = 14), the method for motion correction (  n   = 7), volume acquired per session (  n   = 14), and clear descriptions of the first (  n   = 8) and second level contrasts (  n   = 7). \n  \nfMRI quality assessment of included studies. \n  \n Yes = 1; No or do not know = 0  . \n  \n\n### The Overall Analysis of Activity Results \n  \nAmong the 14 studies that assessed brain activation during inhibitory control tasks after exercise, the exercise groups (EGs) show increased brain activation compared to the control groups (CGs) in six clusters: (1) superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), (2) precuneus (BA 7 and BA 19), (3) superior frontal gyrus (BA 10), and (4) cuneus (BA 19). Five regions showed reduced brain activation: (1) caudate gray matter, (2) posterior cingulate cortex (BA 31), (3) middle temporal gyrus (BA 37), (4) parahippocampal gyrus, and (5) precentral gyrus (BA 6), as shown in   and  . \n  \nALE clusters derived from inhibitory control task in overall analysis. \n  \n R, right; L, left  . \n    \nResults of the ALE meta-analysis show increased and reduced activation for inhibitory control in the EGs compared with CGs. Uncorrected   p   < 0.001 and cluster size >100 mm  (from   A\u2013D  : activation is increased, and from   E\u2013J  : activation is decreased). \n  \n\n### Coactivation Maps \n  \nCoactivation maps were plotted after the MACM analysis, as shown the  . To understand the correspondence between the obtained coactivation maps and the brain functional connectivity networks, we compared it with the cortical parcellation atlas built by Yeo et al. ( ) on 1,000 healthy young subjects. We found that multiple functional networks, including the frontoparietal network, visual network, default mode network, and attention network, overlap with brain regions with ALE results, although this is a subjective judgment. \n  \nThe results of co-activation maps. \n  \n R, right; L, left  . \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe primary aim of the ALE meta-analysis in this study is to offer the first quantitative summary of the effect of exercise on increased and decreased neural activity of different brain areas during inhibitory control tasks. We identified five clusters of increased neural activity [left superior temporal gyrus, right precuneus (BA 7 and BA 19), right superior frontal gyrus, and right cuneus] and five clusters of diminished neural activity (left parahippocampal, right posterior cingulate, right middle temporal and right precentral gyrus, and right caudate) following exercise. MACM analysis suggested that inhibitory control involved multiple functional networks. These findings may help identify the underlying mechanisms of increased inhibitory control that are exercise-induced. \n\nPrevious work found that the neurophysiological mechanism that controls movement is located in the prefrontal cortex (Niendam et al.,  ; Ardila et al.,  ). Our finding shows that there are changes in brain activity in the superior frontal and precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe. It should be noted that both of these regions are responsible for motor control (Niendam et al.,  ; Ardila et al.,  ). \n\nThe superior frontal gyrus is also part of the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for cognitive control functions. This is closely connected with high-level cognitive functions such as interference inhibition, conflict solving, and selective attention (Cabeza and Nyberg,  ; Baym et al.,  ). The precentral gyrus is part of the supplementary motor area (SMA), which is essential for cognitive control as found in previous studies of concern, especially when motor movements need to be inhibited (Nachev et al.,  ; Aron,  ). \n\nOur findings showed one change in brain activity in the parietal lobe is the precuneus. The precuneus region is an essential area for attention selection and response to conflict (Indovina and Macaluso,  ). Previous research found that it plays a pivotal role in the prefrontal-parietal circuit when performing inhibitory tasks (Garavan et al.,  ; Mehren et al.,  ). Thus, this study concludes that exercise is closely related to connectivity in the frontoparietal network. However, more studies are needed to verify this conclusion. \n\nBesides, the finding showed that three regions' activity changed, including the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and caudate in the temporal lobe during inhibitory control tasks. It is worthy to note that the superior temporal sulcus typically provides the amygdala with visual information that contributes to identifying the affective or motivational significance of visually perceived objects (Arzimanoglou et al.,  ). An aerobic intervention experiment by Hsu et al. ( ) showed that aerobic intervention alters the activation of the superior temporal gyrus in patients with cognitive impairment and pointed out that there is an apparent correlation between the activation of the superior temporal gyrus and the reaction speed in the go/no-go task. Liu-Ambrose et al. found that after 52 elderly subjects received resistance training twice a week for 12 months, the pathway extending from the left anterior middle temporal gyrus and the left anterior insula to the lateral orbitofrontal cortex was activated during the flanker task (Liu-Ambrose et al.,  ). \n\nIt has been proven that the caudate is one of the primary input nuclei receiving inputs from the prefrontal cortex and transferring information to the basal ganglia (Kunishio and Haber,  ; Haber et al.,  ; Nakahara et al.,  ). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-caudate circuit was also shown to be involved in proactive inhibition   via   the indirect pathway (Jahfari et al.,  ). We speculate that exercise effectively activates these pathways in response to inhibitory tasks. However, additional experiments are required for verification. \n\nFinally, we found posterior cingulate gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus have activation changes, and these two regions both belong to the limbic structures. The posterior cingulate gyrus is close to the limbic system and belongs to the cortical region functioning as a gateway between the limbic system and the midbrain and diencephalon (Li et al.,  ). Since the posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus are identified here, we hypothesize that exhibited hyper-connectivity (i.e., stronger positive connectivity) is shown in the default mode network (DMN) regions during inhibitory control tasks which is consistent with findings in previous studies (Yu et al.,  ). Furthermore, the degree of coupling between the DMN and the frontal-parietal network positively correlates with overall cognitive function. Therefore, the DMN, which is the main component for the stop signal in inhibitory tasks is particularly significant for the impact of physical exercise on inhibitory control ability. \n\nThe parahippocampal gyrus is an active region in the limbic system, and exercise intervention appears to strengthen their neuronal excitability, increase the volume of white matter/gray matter, and positively change the production of brain-derived neural factors (Li et al.,  ; Loprinzi,  ; Muller et al.,  ; Ji et al.,  ). Previous research has validated the effect of exercise on the plasticity of the parahippocampal gyrus, which plays a crucial role in maintaining memory function and aids in spatial information processing and object recognition (Brown and Aggleton,  ; Raslau et al.,  ). We guess that the parahippocampal gyrus of spatial information processing and object recognition functions are also likely the underlying reason(s) that exercise improves cognitive control function. \n\nThere are some limitations to this study. First, only 14 studies are included, which is a smaller sample size. As a result, a subgroup analysis of the exercise intensity and type of exercise is challenging. Second, this study contains different inhibitory control tasks; although the flanker, go-no-go, and stroop tasks are all standard tasks for measuring inhibitory control, the components are slightly different. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nNeural mechanisms increase exercise-induced inhibitory control by changing the activation of single and multiple brain regions. We guess that critical areas mediate inhibitory control and are associated with the frontoparietal, visual network, DMN, and other pathways. However, due to the lenient threshold used in the ALE analysis, further research with more rigorous methods is required to link exercise to neuroplasticity changes with respect to inhibitory control. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nJW and ZR were responsible for the conceptualization, investigation, and hypothesis of the research.

In recent decades, numerous studies have been investigating the therapeutic potential of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a non-invasive therapy for schizophrenia. However, its clinical efficacy remains controversial, as a number of clinical trials indicated moderate therapeutic effect while others failed to reproduce the positive result. Moreover, the neurobiological mechanism of action remains unclear, possibly constricting the application of TMS in clinical practice. The present protocol of meta-analysis aims to investigate the TMS-related functional neuroimaging (ie, functional MRI) features and alterations in subjects with schizophrenia, and to discuss the potential of functional MRI in TMS researches. \n\n\n## Methods and analysis \n  \nThe study selection process will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Meta-Analyses guideline and quality assessment will be conducted with a customised checklist. We plan to search in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, OVID, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data, from their respective dates of inception to 1 May 2020, with language restricted to English and Chinese. Studies focusing on the brain functional alterations in patients with schizophrenia treated by TMS will be retrieved. \n\n\n## Ethics and dissemination \n  \nThis work does not require ethics approval as it will be based on published studies. This systematic review will be publicly disseminated in peer-reviewed journals. \n\n\n## PROSPERO registration number \n  \nCRD42020166288. \n\n \n\n# Body\n    Strengths and limitations of this study     \nThis is a novel meta-analysis focusing particularly on brain functional MRI in the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy for schizophrenia. \n  \nThis study will provide informative evaluation of the clinical efficacy of repetitive TMS and shed light on its neural substrate of action. \n  \nThe present protocol mainly focuses on the brain functional changes and the general symptomatic improvement induced by TMS, therefore fails to discuss the effect of different stimulation parameters. \n  \nThe limit of this study is connected with the cross-study heterogeneity that affects the external validity. \n  \nWe use public data that will be freely available after publication. \n   \n## Introduction \n  \nKnown for its prominent psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusion, schizophrenia (SZ), with a lifetime prevalence of 0.30%\u20130.66% in the general population,  is a severe psychiatric illness that tends to be chronic and recurrent, leading to varying degrees of cognitive impairment and social disability. \n\nSince a substantial proportion of patients are resistant to first-line antipsychotics, pharmacological interventions are sometimes insufficient in the treatment for SZ.  As a non-invasive neurostimulation technique, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) seems to be a promising add-on therapy that regulates brain function by activating or suppressing neural activity in an effective and safe manner, even though the evidences are controversial. A number of previous studies have explored the role of TMS in the treatment of cognitive deficit,  auditory hallucinations (AH) and negative symptoms.  For instance, 20 Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was considered a safe and well-tolerated treatment for negative symptoms and cognitive deficit of SZ.  However, a randomised, double-blind and sham-controlled trial suggested that therapeutic rTMS administered to the DLPFC in SZ did not result in evident cognitive enhancing effects.  Data from several studies using functional MRI (fMRI) have supported that rTMS on language-perception area can alleviate AH without any impact on functional connectivity (FC) within the language network,  while few other studies have found the FC alteration as the symptom relieved. In an update (2014\u20132018) of the evidence-based guidelines on the therapeutic use of rTMS, experts reviewed its curative effect on AH and negative symptoms; unfortunately, the strong heterogeneity between studies failed to support an extensive clinical application of such treatment. \n\nIn recent studies of meta-analysis, researchers believe that the placebo effect, publication bias and the frequently mentioned cross-trial heterogeneity contributed to the uncertain efficacy of TMS therapy for SZ.  Therefore, in addition to focusing solely on the change of symptomatic features, further explorations on optimisation of stimulation parameters, as well as the neurobiological factors associated with treatment response, are of clinical necessity, so as to provide experiment basis for reliable and effective treatment strategies. \n\nIn fact, neuroimaging technique plays an important role in evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of TMS and exploring its neurobiological mechanism of action. A systematic review including 12 studies\u20143 of which involving fMRI\u2014discussed the major contributions of neuroimaging to TMS research in mainly two aspects: (1) for guiding the coil placement, and (2) for understanding the functional activation and connectivity in SZ.  For example, according to some later studies, the treatment targets for AH are mostly identified by performing a language task during fMRI. In a 2012 study, the n-back task was performed twice on a group of patients during the pretreatment and post-treatment fMRI scan, in order to investigate treatment-related brain activation.  Another brain connectivity and AH review indicated that FC alterations of the default-mode network may be related to hallucinations, and therefore rTMS\u2014with its neuromodulatory effects on targeted cortical sites and their associated networks\u2014is a promising treatment option for symptoms associated with altered connectivity in SZ.  In addition, a multimodal fMRI\u2013rTMS study demonstrated changes in cortical plasticity in human during executive cognition. \n\nDespite the extensive fMRI research we mentioned earlier, considerable variability of results exists between these studies, and as far as we are aware of, there has been no meta-analysis to date on studies investigating brain functional alteration induced by therapeutic TMS for SZ. Here we intend to describe the protocol for a meta-analysis aiming to summarise the TMS-related functional neuroimaging features in subjects with SZ, and consequently, to evaluate its clinical efficacy and explore the neural mechanism of action. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nThis meta-analysis aims to integrate and assess the features of brain function in SZ after receiving TMS. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 statement. \n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \n#### Study types \n  \nCohort studies and randomised controlled trials will be included only if the neuroimaging results are available. Case\u2013control studies, case reports, narrative or systematic reviews, meta-analyses, letters and other secondhand studies will be excluded. \n\n\n#### Study design \n  \nBoth resting-state and task neuroimaging studies investigating functional activity or connectivity in patients with SZ treated with active or sham-TMS will be included. Longitudinal studies focusing on the management of SZ will also be considered, but only if the baseline neuroimaging data are available. Studies that (1) did not report whole-brain analyses, or (2) did not report coordinates in either Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space, or (3) solely focusing on brain structure, will all be excluded. \n\n\n#### Participants \n  \nStudies with subjects with SZ with or without a healthy control group (all without any known severe neurological condition or head trauma) are required. The minimum sample size will be 12 subjects per group, according to previous studies.  Race, age and medication (ie, drug-na\u00efve or medicated) will not be restricted. \n\n\n#### Interventions \n  \nActive TMS or rTMS, and sham-TMS. \n\n\n#### Outcome measures \n  \nSince we focus on therapeutic TMS-induced neuroimaging alteration in SZ, the main outcomes of the included studies are brain regions that indicate significant functional changes, including whole-brain functional activity or FC, and should be presented in MNI or Talairach coordinates. \n\nThe secondary result will be psychotic symptom improvement indexed by the score of Positive and Negative symptom Scale,  the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale or any other clinical assessment scales (eg, the Manchester Scale) reported in the included studies. \n\n\n#### Report characteristics \n  \nOnly published and peer-reviewed original studies in English or Chinese will be included. The date of publication should be prior to 1 May 2020, the anticipated completion date of this review. \n\n\n#### Searching strategy \n  \nThe following sources will be searched: PubMed, OVID, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang Data, using Medical Subject Headings terms. The searching strategies of PubMed (English) and CNKI (Chinese) are presented in   and will be applied to the other databases. \n  \nSearching strategy \n    \n\n\n### Selection process \n  \nEndNote V.X7 software (Thomson Reuters, New York, New York, USA) will be used to manage literature. After removing duplicates, studies identified by the literature search will be removed independently by SZ and YF, based on title and abstract. Then, the rest of the literature will be assessed by full-text screening for the final inclusion for this review. Any disagreement between the two reviewers will be reconsidered by a third reviewer, BZ. Reasons for study exclusion will be reported. \n\n\n### Data collection \n  \nThe two independent reviewers (SZ and YF) will doubly extract data using a standard data extraction spreadsheet in Excel. Again, any inconsistency between reviewers will be reconsidered and the result determined by the third reviewer (BZ). The following items will be extracted from each record. (1) Publication information: title, first author, publishing time, unit, country or region, and funding support. (2) Details of methodology: participants, sample size, diagnostic criteria, demographic characteristics (including age, gender and so on), imaging modalities, scanner resolution, data analysis strategies, clinical assessments and clinical variables (eg, illness duration and severity, and so on). (3) Results: the significantly altered cerebral regions (defined by MNI/Talairach coordinates, cluster size and statistical threshold), the results of clinical assessments, and the correlations between imaging data and clinical data. \n\nAny missing information or questions about the above data will be settled by contacting the authors. If no clarification is provided within 4 weeks, the study will be included in the final analysis with its missing information reported. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nSo far, there has been no standard checklist for quality assessment of individual functional neuroimaging studies. We will adopt a checklist (see  ) published in a previous meta-analysis. \n   Quality assessment of individual studies   \n#### Category 1: sample characteristics (10) \n    \nPatients were evaluated with specific standardised diagnostic criteria (1). \n  \nImportant demographic data (age and gender) were reported with mean (or median) and SDs (or range) (2). \n  \nHealthy control subjects were evaluated to exclude psychiatric and medical illnesses and demographic data were reported (1). \n  \nImportant clinical variables (eg, positive and negative symptom, medication status, and illness duration and severity) were reported with mean (or median) and SDs (or range) (4). \n  \nSample size per group >10 (2). \n  \n\n#### Category 2: methodology and reporting (10) \n    \nWhole brain analysis was automated with no a priori regional selection (3). \n  \nMagnet strength at least 1.5T (1). \n  \nAt least 5 min of resting state acquisition (1). \n  \nWhole brain coverage of resting scans (1). \n  \nThe acquisition and preprocessing techniques were clearly described so that they could be reproduced (1). \n  \nCoordinates reported in a standard space (1). \n  \nSignificant results are reported after correction for multiple testing using a standard statistical procedure (AlphaSim, FDR, FWE or permutation-based methods) (1). \n  \nConclusions were consistent with the results obtained and the limitations were discussed (1). \n  \nFDR, false discovery rate; FWE, family-wise error rate. \n\n \nTwo independent reviewers (SZ and YF) will examine for any potential study bias, such as the characteristics of the sample, the methods of randomisation and blinding, the completeness of outcome data and others, using the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s tool. The assessment will be done at study level. Inconsistencies between SZ and YF will be settled by discussions with the third reviewer (BZ). \n\n\n### Data synthesis \n  \nAll collected data will be put together in a table, including the total and average sample size, age range of subjects, mean duration of illnesses, as well as the clinical assessment results. We will perform a qualitative analysis to examine whether the different functional patterns exist in SZ after the TMS treatment compared with the baseline. Also, we will summarise these results by task-based or resting-state fMRI. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nFirst, the coordinates in MNI and Talairach space extracted from the included studies will be converted to one another for the convenience of our analysis. An activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis will then be performed to integrate consistent brain regions with significant functional alteration reported in different studies, using GingerALE V.3.0.2 ( ). In the ALE algorithm, the peak coordinates extracted from studies represent their own clusters and were registered as centres in the 3D Gaussian probability distribution. The sizes of these clusters were estimated with experimental design of each study, including sample sizes, between-subject variations, normalising methods and others. Finally, an ALE map was calculated by merging all modelled activation maps obtained through voxel-wise aggregation of all clusters reported in each experiment. This ALE map was then compared against a randomly permuted null-distribution to test for statistical significance. \n\nTo assess the stability of the outcomes, the leave-one-out jackknife sensitivity analysis will be performed using GingerALE. Specifically, this is a procedure that iteratively recalculate the effect size by excluding a different study from the sample at a time and then repeating the analyses. If necessary, subgroup analysis will be performed based on different stimulation parameters of TMS (frequency, intensity and others) and courses of the disease (ie, first-episode or chronic SZ). \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7713205, "text_md5": "bd7e901ace8e1bb3ec63e098cec5bf86", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 68], "journal": [69, 77], "publication_year": [79, 83], "title": [94, 225], "keywords": [239, 317], "abstract": [330, 2058], "body": [2067, 15371]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33268405, "doi": "10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038557", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7713205", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7713205"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7713205\">7713205</a>", "list_title": "PMC7713205  Functional MRI in the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for patients with schizophrenia: a meta-analysis protocol"}

Previous studies have provided conflicting results with respect to neural abnormalities in gain processing in addiction, and few investigations into loss processing. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe conducted voxel-wise meta-analyses of abnormal task-evoked regional activities in adults with substance dependence and gambling addiction during the processing of gains and losses not related to their addiction (mainly monetary). We identified 24 studies, including 465 participants with substance dependence, 81 with gambling addiction and 490 healthy controls. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared with healthy controls, all participants with addictions showed hypoactivations in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and insula and hyperactivations in the default mode network during gain anticipation; hyperactivations in the prefrontal cortex and both hyper- and hypoactivations in the striatum during loss anticipation; and hyperactivations in the occipital lobe during gain outcome. In the substance dependence subgroup, activity in the occipital lobe was increased during gain anticipation but decreased during loss anticipation. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nWe were unable to conduct meta-analyses in the gambling addiction subgroup because of a limited data set. We did not investigate the effects of clinical variables because of limited information. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe current study identified altered brain activity associated with higher- and lower-level function during gain and loss processing for non-addiction (mainly monetary) stimuli in adults with substance dependence and gambling addiction. Adults with addiction were more sensitive to anticipatory gains than losses at higher- and lower-level brain areas. These results may help us to better understand the pathology of gain and loss processing in addiction. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAddiction refers to a situation in which substances or activities become the major focus of a person\u2019s life and cause physical or mental harm to the person with the addiction or to other people, a result of the obsession with the addictive substances or behaviours and the exclusion of other activities. Substance dependence is characterized by problematic substance use (e.g., alcohol, cocaine or cannabis),  which may induce changes in the brain and give rise to physical and psychological disturbances. ,  In 2019, 35 million people worldwide were estimated to have substance dependence.  Globally, 4.2% and 1.3% of disease burden  were attributable to alcohol and drug use, respectively.  Similar to substance dependence, gambling addiction is an addictive behaviour associated with morbidity and harm. The 12-month prevalence for gambling addiction among adults ranges from 0.1% to 6.0% worldwide.  Gambling addiction is associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, which result from risk factors such as financial difficulties and depression.  As well, people with gambling addiction have high rates of comorbid substance dependence.  Given that addictions such as substance dependence and gambling addiction lead to distress and harm, it is crucial to understand their neural pathophysiology. \n\nGain and loss processing (or reward and loss processing) refer to the ability to learn from rewarding or undesirable stimuli by assigning specific values to the objects or actions in our environment  and using that information to guide future behaviours. Disturbances in gain processing \u2014 and to a lesser extent, loss processing \u2014 have been extensively reported in substance dependence  and gambling addiction.  Most experimental paradigms for gain and loss processing require participants to make responses to gain rewards (not related to the addiction, such as money gain or visual erotic rewards) and avoid losses, and to allow for the analysis of different processing phases, such as the anticipation and outcome periods. To control for irrelevant factors such as visual processing of the stimuli and motor processing during responses (i.e., button pressing), researchers usually compare gain or loss trials to neutral trials in which participants have no gain or loss. Such gain\u2013 or loss\u2013neutral contrasts permit the analysis of valence-related (i.e., gain or loss) task activation by theoretically making valence the most salient difference among the conditions. \n\nTo date, neuroimaging techniques \u2014 especially functional MRI (fMRI) \u2014 have been widely used to reveal altered gain and loss processing in adults with substance dependence and gambling addiction. ,  The neural basis underlying gain and loss processing involves several brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the ventral striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex. ,  Previous studies have revealed both hyper-and hypoactivity in reward-related regions during both the expectation and receipt of non-drug (mainly monetary) gains in people with addiction compared to healthy controls. Some researchers have observed hypoactivation of the ventral striatum in people with cocaine addiction during both gain and loss anticipation,  and hypoactivation of the inferior prefrontal gyrus in smokers during gain outcome notification.  However, other researchers have reported enhanced activation of the ventral striatum in people with alcohol addiction during gain anticipation,  enhanced activity in the ventromedial PFC in smokers during loss anticipation  and enhanced activation of the ventral striatum in cannabis-dependent patients during loss outcome notification.  Similarly, people with gambling addiction have demonstrated diminished activity in the ventral striatum, the ventromedial PFC and the insula during anticipation of both gain and loss,  as well as diminished activation of the PFC in response to monetary gain and loss outcomes.  However, gambling addiction has also been associated with enhanced activity in the right ventral striatum during loss anticipation,  and enhanced activity in the bilateral ventral striatum and left orbital frontal cortex during gain outcome notification.  In addition, some researchers have found no significant differences between people with addiction and healthy controls. For example, Bjork and colleagues  found that people with alcohol addiction and healthy controls both showed similar activation patterns in the ventral striatum during gain and loss anticipation for monetary rewards. \n\nTo unravel these inconsistent findings (i.e., both hyper- and hypoactivity in reward-related regions during gain and loss processing compared to healthy controls), researchers have been trying to investigate neural abnormalities in addiction from the perspective of meta-analysis.  Meta-analysis is a statistical process for synthesizing data from multiple independent studies, calculating an overall effect.  By conducting meta-analyses, Luijten and colleagues  revealed altered brain activity in people with addiction compared to healthy controls during the anticipation and outcome receipt of monetary rewards, further confirming these results separately in people with substance dependence and gambling addiction. They showed that people with substance dependence and gambling addiction both exhibited attenuated striatal activity compared to healthy controls during gain anticipation, but that people with substance dependence showed enhanced activity in the ventral striatum and people with gambling addiction showed reduced activity in the dorsal striatum during gain outcome. This was an interesting and valuable meta-analysis, and it provided some directions for further investigation. First, it synthesized findings only for gain-related phases, not loss-related phases. Although gain and loss processing seem to capture overlapping neural mechanisms in the healthy population, especially during the anticipation phase,  how these 2 processes are impaired in people with addiction is as yet unclear. It is likely that they undergo distinct changes in the brain, because gains and losses are valued differently  and they are assigned different weights when people make decisions.  Specifically, although altered gain processing may give rise to misrepresentations of rewards (e.g., hypersensitivity to addiction-related rewards according to incentive sensitization theory , ), impaired loss processing may or may not show the same effect on the evaluation of punishments. Therefore, investigating alterations in loss processing for people with addiction is as important as understanding gain processing. Second, some studies included in the meta-analysis contrasted gain trials with neutral trials, and others contrasted gains directly with losses. This mix of gain\u2013neutral contrasts (20 data sets) and gain\u2013loss contrasts (5 data sets) in a single meta-analysis  makes it difficult to gain insight into brain-activity alterations for these 2 processes with opposing valences. ,  Third, because this meta-analysis focused primarily on activation of the striatum, findings from some region-of-interest (ROI) analyses were also included. Findings may be biased because of the ROI choices, and inferences from these findings should be treated with caution. \n\nOverall, based on the studies mentioned above, our metaanalysis aimed to integrate brain imaging data from multiple studies published between 2000 and 2019 to investigate the differences between adults with addiction and healthy controls during the processing of non-addiction (mainly monetary) gains and losses. By applying criteria that were more stringent than those of the previous meta-analysis, we hoped to provide a better understanding of the nature and direction of impaired neural activity in addiction. Because the differences in loss processing between people with addiction and healthy controls seem to be less well understood, we hoped to gain more insights in this regard. Finally, we hoped to provide indications for future research with the aim of developing interventions for substance dependence and gambling addiction. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nWe searched Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science for articles published in English from Jan. 1, 2000, to Dec. 1, 2019, using the following terms and their derivatives: \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cfMRI\u201d; AND \u201creward\u201d OR \u201creward processing\u201d; AND \u201closs processing\u201d; AND \u201cdrug abuse\u201d OR \u201cdrug use\u201d OR \u201cdrug addiction\u201d OR \u201csubstance use\u201d OR \u201csubstance dependence\u201d OR \u201ccocaine\u201d OR \u201cmarijuana\u201d OR \u201ccannabis\u201d OR \u201cTHC\u201d OR \u201cmethamphetamine\u201d OR \u201camphetamine\u201d OR \u201cecstasy\u201d OR \u201cMDMA\u201d OR \u201cheroin\u201d OR \u201copiate\u201d OR \u201copioid addiction\u201d OR \u201cpolysubstance\u201d OR \u201calcohol\u201d OR \u201ccigarette\u201d OR \u201cnicotine dependence\u201d OR \u201calcohol abuse\u201d OR \u201calcohol dependence\u201d OR \u201calcohol addiction\u201d OR \u201cnicotine addiction.\u201d We also examined the reference lists of relevant review articles to include additional papers. \n\nA study was included if it was published in English in a peer-reviewed journal between 2000 and 2019, used fMRI, compared neural activation between adult human participants with substance dependence or gambling addiction and adult human healthy controls, used tasks that required participants to complete an action to obtain rewards and/or avoid losses, and reported significant results of whole-brain analyses as 3-dimensional coordinates in standard stereotactic coordinate space (i.e., Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute). \n\nA study was excluded if it was conducted in non-human or non-adult participants, did not include a healthy control group, included occasional users (e.g., occasional smokers) in the addiction group and/or the control group, used the same patient data as other included studies, was a diffusion tensor imaging study or a connectivity study, did not examine task-based neural activation (e.g., resting-state fMRI study), involved tasks in which rewarding stimuli or losing events were presented passively, or included only ROI findings. Reviews and meta-analyses were also excluded. \n\nWe assessed the quality of each study included in this meta-analysis using a 9-point checklist (Appendix 1, Table S1, available at  ). The current study was performed according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.  See   for the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram indicating the number of studies located and included. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \n#### Voxel-wise meta-analysis \n  \nWe used a seed-based d-mapping software package (SDM version 5.15;  ) to perform meta-analyses on neural activity differences between addiction groups and healthy controls. The SDM approach makes it possible to combine statistical parametric maps and reported peak coordinates, described elsewhere. \u2013  To summarize, we first extracted peak coordinates and effect sizes (  t  -values) of neural activity differences between addiction groups and healthy controls from each included study. We converted the effect sizes, reported as   z   scores or   p   values, to   t   values using an online converter ( ). Second, we recreated a standard Montreal Neurological Institute map of the activation differences by applying an anisotropic Gaussian kernel for each included study. In contrast to isotropic kernels \u2014 which may underestimate the effect size of voxels from the same brain area while overestimating the effect size of voxels from other areas \u2014 anisotropic kernels can improve the plausibility of the maps by assigning different values to distinct voxels surrounding a peak based on their spatial correlations.  Third, we applied a random-effects generalized linear model to generate the mean map by fitting the effect size maps into this model. As a result, included studies were weighted differentially based on their sample sizes, between-study heterogeneities and intra-study variances, amplifying the contributions of studies with larger sample sizes or lower variance. \n\nWe conducted meta-analyses between all addiction groups and healthy controls for different combinations of phases of gain and loss processing (i.e., anticipation and outcome) and outcome types (i.e., gain and loss): gain anticipation, loss anticipation and gain outcome. In most studies, the anticipation phase was the waiting period after the onset of a meaningful cue that signalled a potential gain, loss or neutral outcome (e.g., A1 period in Appendix 1, Figure S1). Following this, participants were required to make an active response to a target; however, in 2 studies ,  the anticipation phase was defined as the waiting period after participants made a response to the target (e.g., A2 period in Appendix 1, Figure S1). The outcome phase is the period immediately after feedback (i.e., winning, losing or neutral) from participants\u2019 earlier response within the same trial (e.g., outcome period in Appendix 1, Figure S1). For our primary analyses, we conducted meta-analyses of gain\u2013neutral contrasts between addiction groups and healthy controls for both the anticipation and outcome phases, and of loss\u2013neutral contrasts for the anticipation phase. By contrasting responses to gains or losses against a neutral condition or a baseline, we could gather less noisy and more cogent evidence for gain- and loss-related neural abnormalities in people with addiction than by directly comparing gain-related with loss-related responses. We calculated differences between addiction groups and healthy controls in each voxel and determined statistical significance using a standard randomization test. ,  In this meta-analysis, we used the default kernel size and thresholds in SDM (  p   < 0.005 with peak height   Z   > 1 and a cluster extent of > 10 voxels) to optimize sensitivity and control false positives. ,  We did not conduct comparisons for the loss outcome because of the small number of studies. \n\nWe repeated separate meta-analyses for the phase-by-type combinations for the substance dependence subgroup, but not for the gambling addiction subgroup, because of a limited number of studies. And because of insufficient data for variables such as mean duration of substance use, we did not conduct meta-regression analyses in this study. \n\n\n#### Jackknife sensitivity analysis \n  \nWe examined the replicability of the findings by conducting a systematic whole-brain, voxel-based jackknife sensitivity analysis. This involved repeating the main statistical analysis but removing 1 study each time, calculating the stability of the findings using the remaining studies.  A result for the jackknife sensitivity analysis indicated the ratio between the number of study combinations that produced a significant result in 1 specific region and the number of all study combinations. If a brain region remained significant in all or most of the study combinations, we considered the finding to be highly replicable. \n\n\n#### Analyses of heterogeneity and publication bias \n  \nWe performed a heterogeneity analysis using   Q   statistic maps to investigate unexplained between-study variability in the findings.  We also performed Egger\u2019s test to look for potential publication bias in these findings by extracting the values of significant peaks of comparison between the addiction groups and healthy controls. \n\n\n#### Supplementary analyses \n  \nWe conducted supplementary analyses for gain anticipation and gain outcome by including gain\u2013loss contrasts and gain\u2013neutral contrasts. We did not repeat these analyses for loss anticipation because of a limited number of data sets. To reveal whether differences in definitions of the anticipation phase affected our findings, we repeated the analyses for gain and loss anticipation for all addictions after excluding the 2 studies with different definitions of the anticipation phase. ,  We did not repeat these analyses for the substance dependence subgroup because of the small number of studies. We did not investigate any sex or gender differences in our extracted data, because the included studies did not report results separately for males and females, or report the differences between males and females. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included studies and sample characteristics \n  \nThe literature search yielded 560 publications, and after reviewing the titles and abstracts of all studies, we identified 310 fMRI studies for full-text review. Of the 310 studies, 60 were resting-state fMRI studies that did not investigate task-related brain activations; 122 did not employ tasks that required participants to actively complete an action to obtain a reward or avoid a loss; 55 did not include a healthy control group; 34 did not conduct a whole-brain analysis; 7 did not report significant clusters; and 2 did not compare activation differences between the addiction groups and healthy controls. We excluded these studies from the meta-analysis. We also excluded another 4 studies because occasional users or gamblers were part of either the experimental or the control group. We also excluded 1 case study, and 1 study that did not provide data on the contrasts we needed. \n\nAltogether, we identified 24 studies reporting 26 data sets for the current meta-analysis: 21 substance dependence data sets (465 people with substance dependence and 441 matched healthy controls) and 5 gambling addiction data sets (81 people with gambling addiction and 85 matched healthy controls). Of the 5 gambling addiction studies, 3 did not include participants with a gambling addiction who had comorbid substance dependence. One study included participants with gambling addiction and nicotine dependence, but the authors conducted additional analyses controlling for participants\u2019 smoking status and found no confounding effect of smoking habits on the results.  Another study included participants with both gambling addiction and nicotine dependence and did not investigate the effects of nicotine dependence.  However, this study did not affect our results because we did not conduct a separate subgroup analysis on gambling addiction. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the included studies are shown in  . The quality score for each study and other information (including experimental paradigms and image acquisition techniques) can be found in Appendix 1, Tables S1 to S3. \n\n\n### Gain anticipation \n  \n#### All addictions versus healthy controls \n  \nTwelve studies were included in the comparison of all addictions and healthy controls. All addictions exhibited significant hyperactivation in the left angular gyrus/inferior parietal gyrus (extending to the left middle temporal gyrus; Brodmann areas [BAs] 22, 39) and right precuneus. All addictions showed hypoactivation in the left striatum, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (BAs 11, 38, 45), bilateral supplementary motor areas (BAs 6, 8), left fusiform gyrus (BA 37) and right superior temporal gyrus (extending to the right insula; BA 38). See   and   for detailed results. \n\n\n#### Substance dependence subgroup versus healthy controls \n  \nEight studies were included in the comparison of the substance dependence subgroup and healthy controls. The substance dependence subgroup exhibited significant hyperactivation in the left angular gyrus (extending to the left middle temporal gyrus; BAs 22, 39), right superior occipital gyrus (BA 19) and left middle occipital gyrus (BA 39). It showed hypoactivation in the left striatum (extending to the left inferior frontal gyrus; BA 11), left middle frontal gyrus (BA 46), left fusiform gyrus (BA 37) and left supplementary motor area (BA 6). See   and   for detailed results. \n\n\n\n### Loss anticipation \n  \n#### All addictions versus healthy controls \n  \nTen studies were included in the comparison of all addictions and healthy controls. All addictions exhibited significant hyperactivation in the bilateral postcentral gyrus (extending to the left inferior parietal gyrus excluding supramarginal and angular; BAs 3, 4, 6), right striatum, left middle frontal gyrus (extending to the left superior frontal gyrus; BA 10) and right inferior frontal gyrus (opercular part, BA 48). All addictions showed hypoactivation in the bilateral striatum (extending to the left temporal pole; BAs 20, 38, 48), left inferior frontal gyrus (BAs 45, 47, 48) and left fusiform gyrus ( extending to the left lingual gyrus; BAs 18, 19). See   and   for detailed results. \n\n\n#### Substance dependence subgroup versus healthy controls \n  \nSeven studies were included in the comparison of the substance dependence subgroup and healthy controls. The substance dependence subgroup exhibited no significant brain hyperactivation. However, it did show hypoactivation in the left striatum, left lingual gyrus (extending to the left fusiform and left inferior occipital gyrus; BAs 18, 19) and left middle occipital gyrus (BA 19). See   and   for detailed results. \n\n\n\n### Gain outcome \n  \n#### All addictions versus healthy controls \n  \nFifteen studies were included in the comparison of all addictions and healthy controls. All addictions exhibited significant hyperactivation in the right middle occipital gyrus (extending to the right superior occipital gyrus; BAs 7, 19), and the right temporal pole (BAs 20, 38). They showed no significant brain hypoactivation. See   and   for detailed results. \n\n\n#### Substance dependence subgroup versus healthy controls \n  \nEleven studies were included in the comparison of the substance dependence subgroup and healthy controls. The substance dependence subgroup exhibited significant hyperactivation in the right hippocampus (BA 28). It showed hypoactivation in the right median cingulate/paracingulate gyri (BA 23). See   and   for detailed results. \n\n\n\n### Jackknife sensitivity analysis \n  \nThe findings described above remained largely unchanged under jackknife sensitivity analysis, indicating high robustness ( \u2013 ). \n\n\n### Analyses of heterogeneity and publication bias \n  \nThe heterogeneity analysis showed nonsignificant results for most of the reported regions, except the left striatum for the comparisons of all addictions and the substance dependence subgroup versus healthy controls during gain anticipation. The results of the heterogeneity analysis and Egger\u2019s test are summarized in  \u2013 . \n\n\n### Supplementary analyses \n  \nThe results of the meta-analyses of gain\u2013loss and gain\u2013neutral contrasts are shown in Appendix 1, Tables S4 (gain anticipation) and S5 (gain outcome). The results from analyses after excluding the 2 studies with a different definition of the anticipation phase are shown in Appendix 1, Tables S6 (gain anticipation) and S7 (loss anticipation). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur results revealed several patterns of altered brain activation for people with addiction during gain and loss processing, providing new evidence of the neural abnormalities in addiction. First, during gain anticipation, all addictions showed reduced brain activation in the striatum, PFC and insula compared to healthy controls, and enhanced brain activation in the precuneus, angular gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal gyrus. The substance dependence subgroup showed very similar patterns, with additional hyperactivation in the occipital lobe. Second, during loss anticipation, all addictions exhibited enhanced activation in the striatum and PFC compared to healthy controls. However, the striatum also showed attenuated activity. A separate analysis for the substance dependence subgroup revealed hypoactivation in the striatum and occipital lobe. Third, during gain outcome, all addictions showed enhanced activation in the occipital lobe. \n\n### Neural alterations during gain anticipation \n  \nAll addictions exhibited decreased activation in the PFC (BA 45, inferior frontal gyrus), left striatum and right insula compared to healthy controls (  and  ). The striatum and PFC are important components of the reward network. The striatum is crucial for reward experiences and learning,  and the PFC is crucial for reward-based decision-making  and higher-level executive functions, including goal representation and action planning. ,  Functional interconnections between the PFC and the striatum are responsible for reward detection and regulation.  Our results were consistent with those of previous reports of reduced PFC and striatal activity in substance detection  and gambling addiction. , ,  These results could be validated by the incentive sensitization theory ,  and the reward deficiency hypothesis, ,  both of which predict attenuated activity in the reward system during anticipation of non-addiction-related gains. According to the incentive sensitization theory, the neural system of a person with addiction attributes higher incentive salience to addiction-related rewards (e.g., drugs) and less incentive salience to non-addiction-related rewards (e.g., monetary gains). As a result, non-addiction-related stimuli used in the experiments may be rendered less salient for people with addiction, leading to reduced activation of the reward network (i.e., PFC and striatum). According to the reward deficiency hypothesis, however, hypoactivity in the reward network is an indicator of a deficient reward system that cannot be adequately activated by rewarding stimuli (i.e., both addiction-related rewards and non-addiction-related rewards). This pattern of activity can also be explained by the reward allostasis model. ,  According to this model, sensitivity to non-addiction-related gains is reduced as a compensatory process to maintain the stability of the reward functions. Given the limited capacity of the reward circuits, non-addiction-related rewards may be allocated weaker hedonic effects, and addiction-related stimuli may take up more resources. Consequently, the reward circuits should be less activated for people with addiction during anticipation of non-addiction-related gains. \n\nWe also observed reduced activity in the right insula (  and  ). The insula is an important brain region for the integration of internal bodily information, necessary for interoceptive awareness and emotional arousal.  Previous studies have consistently found decreased insular activity in substance dependence  and gambling addiction,  indicating a desensitized interoceptive state. In our study, insular hypoactivation may have denoted weaker interoceptive and emotional responses to non-addiction-related gains compared to addiction-related rewards. In addition, the insula is part of the salience network, which is highly responsive to behaviourally relevant stimuli,  and was consistently upregulated for people with drug addiction during drug-cue exposure.  It may be that for people with addiction, addiction-related cues are more relevant than other rewarding stimuli. Compatible with the allostasis model, the attenuated activity of the salience network (i.e., insula) in people with addiction during anticipation of non-addiction-related gains likely functioned as a compensation for its hypersensitivity to addiction-related cues. \n\nIn contrast, all addictions showed significantly increased activation in the right precuneus, middle temporal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus and angular gyrus compared to healthy controls (  and  ). These regions are important components of the default mode network, which is responsible for self-referential processing and is normally deactivated during cognitive tasks. \u2013  The atypical strengthened activation of the default mode network that we observed in all addictions indicates that the expectation of gains was perhaps associated with the self. It is likely that repeated addictive behaviours in daily life (encompassing the anticipation of the hedonic effects of drugs or monetary wins) are incorporated into self-related memory for people with addiction.  Therefore, when people with addiction anticipated an imminent reward in the experiments, they were likely prompted by a similar memory of the hedonic sensations. Such an association between gains and self-related memory of hedonic sensations is likely much stronger for people with addiction than for healthy controls, ,  leading to a stronger activation of the default mode network for people with addiction. In addition, the precuneus is reported to be crucial for the integration of information from our environment.  It has been suggested that people with addiction showed heightened exteroceptive awareness toward addiction-related cues.  This result is consistent with cue-elicited hyperactivation in the precuneus in substance dependence, ,  likely indicating that more salience was assigned to rewarding stimuli, such as drugs. Therefore, non-addiction-related rewards may hold a \u201cbottom\u2013up\u201d attentional advantage for people with addiction compared to healthy controls. Because people with addiction show impaired interoceptive awareness (shown by hypoactivation of the insula) and strengthened exteroception (shown by hyperactivation of the precuneus), it is not surprising that they seem to perform less well when it comes to monitoring their internal feelings and refraining from addictive behaviours. \n\nThe results described above were largely the same for the substance dependence subgroup, but they showed additional increased activation of the right superior occipital gyrus and left middle occipital gyrus (  and  ). Previous research in rats found that the ability to predict the timing of imminent rewards elicited the activation of the primary visual cortex, which resides in the occipital lobe.  This finding suggests that gain anticipation can be reflected in very early visual processing in animals. In humans, drug-related visual cues have been associated with increased brain activation in early visual regions for people with substance dependence. \u2013  It is likely that for people with drug addiction, frequent and large drug doses increased the responsiveness of the primary visual cortex to cues with rewarding properties. Alterations in the early visual areas are likely specific to substance dependence, because human studies have shown that substance use (i.e., ecstasy) is linked to neurotoxic changes in the occipital lobe  and heightened excitability of the primary visual cortex. \n\n\n### Neural alterations during loss anticipation \n  \nWe found that all addictions showed hyperactivation in the striatum and parts of the PFC (  and  ). Several studies have observed hyperactivation in the PFC and striatum in substance dependence and gambling addiction during loss anticipation. , ,  It has been argued that increased reactivity to potential losses is associated with salience improperly attributed to imminent losing events,  which may lead to loss-chasing, a continued behaviour in an attempt to recover losses.  It has been shown that impulsive behaviours such as loss-chasing are linked to activity in the ventral PFC and striatum. ,  Specifically, researchers have found that heightened PFC activation in smokers is related to increased craving to relieve smoking abstinence.  Thus, people with addiction may be more aroused by the forthcoming loss than healthy controls and have the impulse to chase the loss. Loss-chasing is particularly central to gambling addiction. ,  Thus, the hyperactivities described here may have been driven mainly by the gambling addiction subgroup. \n\nAgainst this, other researchers have found an opposite trend, which we also observed in the current analysis: decreased striatal activity during loss anticipation in addiction. , , ,  Researchers have suggested that such a hypoactivation is associated with an insensitivity to punishment or loss. ,  It has been argued that people with addiction are less sensitive to negative consequences (i.e., losses) and may not be able to activate the brain regions responsible for error tracking and adaptive learning.  The striatum, along with the PFC, is a critical site for these functions, \u2013  helping people to learn from negative events and adjust their future behaviours. \n\nThe conflicting results described above were perhaps caused by the different natures of gambling addiction and substance dependence, the data for which were included in the analysis of all addictions. The impulse to chase losses is a key symptom of problematic gambling.  In our analysis of all addictions, hyperactivation of the brain regions linked with impulsive behaviours (i.e., PFC and striatum) may have been driven mainly by the gambling addiction subgroup. Indeed, a separate analysis of substance dependence did not find enhanced brain activity, but the hypoactivation pattern in the striatum remained significant. However, given the limited number of studies we found on gambling addiction during loss anticipation, this explanation remains speculative. Future research should gain more insights into gain and loss processing in gambling addiction. \n\nThe substance dependence subgroup showed additional hypoactivation in the left middle occipital gyrus and left inferior occipital gyrus (  and  ). Similar to the reward allostasis model, ,  this pattern can be seen as a compensatory process in which functions of the occipital lobe strive for stability during gain and loss processing. As noted above, the occipital lobe exhibited enhanced activation during gain anticipation for people with drug addiction, possibly indicating increased responsiveness of the primary visual cortex to cues of a rewarding nature (e.g., monetary gains). This change may come at the expense of reactivity to cues of an unrewarding nature (e.g., monetary losses). In other words, it is likely that people with drug addiction allocate few resources to losing events during early visual processing, because the primary visual cortex is more receptive to rewarding stimuli.  Indeed, the strengthened responsiveness of the visual cortex has been more extensively documented in the literature on gain processing.  For people with drug addiction to maintain the functional stability of the occipital lobe, loss anticipation should be associated with decreased activation in this region as gain anticipation elicits stronger activation. \n\n\n### Neural alterations during gain outcome \n  \nAll addictions exhibited increased activity in the right middle occipital gyrus and right superior occipital gyrus (  and  ) compared to healthy controls. A previous study found that the occipital lobe was activated more strongly in response to visually presented pleasant stimuli compared to neutral stimuli.  It was argued that the visual cortex is responsive to affective information from the stimuli we see. In addition, addictive behaviours have been positively associated with neuroticism and extroversion, \u2013  2 personality traits that are closely linked to affective sensitivity.  Therefore, it is conceivable that people with addiction are more responsive than healthy controls are to the emotional components of gain outcomes (i.e., pleasantness), even during early visual processing. Our results supported this by showing hyperactivity in the occipital lobe in response to rewarding outcomes. \n\nWe observed no significant hyper- or hypoactivation of the PFC or striatum during gain outcome. This was not surprising, because several studies have obtained similar results. , ,  However, the existing literature also provided a large body of evidence showing altered activity in these regions in addiction. For example, some researchers found reduced activation of the PFC in people with addiction during the delivery of gain outcomes. , , , ,  Others found strengthened activation in both the PFC and striatum. , ,  The discrepancies among the different studies may have been due to methodological factors (including task designs) and participant characteristics (such as addiction severity and abstinence stage). For example, although most studies used the monetary incentive delay task  or a modified version (i.e., substance-unrelated activity incentive delay tasks), some studies used less common paradigms, including the reward prediction task  and the probabilistic reversal learning task.  Participants cannot control the outcomes in paradigms such as the reward prediction task, but they can obtain monetary gains or avoid losses in a monetary incentive delay task. ,  It may be that the responses to predetermined outcomes and the responses to rewards that were actively obtained induced different activation patterns in the brain. In addition, the length of abstinence has been negatively associated with brain activity in monetary gain.  Differences in participants\u2019 abstinence stages or treatment-seeking status were likely other important factors contributing to the conflicting results. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the absence of elevated striatal activity during gain outcome in our study was inconsistent with the meta-analysis by Luijten and colleagues.  This was perhaps because our study selection criteria differed from their work in 2 main aspects. First, we included studies comparing gain- or loss-related responses to responses in neutral conditions (i.e., no-win or no-gain) or a baseline, whereas Luijten and colleagues also included gain\u2013loss contrasts. Second, we included data from whole-brain analyses only, whereas they also used data from ROI analyses. As a result, only half of the studies included in our work overlapped with theirs. In addition, because our meta-analysis was conducted more recently, there were more substance dependence data sets (i.e., 21) than in the previous meta-analysis (i.e., 15). \n\n\n### Loss anticipation versus gain anticipation \n  \nPrevious meta-analyses or reviews did not provide systematic or conclusive findings on loss processing in addiction, ,  possibly because some researchers did not include or report on loss-related trials. , ,  In this study, we compared alterations in brain activity during loss anticipation to gain anticipation in people with addiction. \n\nFirst, although loss anticipation activated the PFC and striatum, gain anticipation showed no such hyperactivity. This was perhaps because the impulse to chase losses was present only when there was the possibility of losing, leading to enhanced activity in regions associated with impulsivity (i.e., the PFC and striatum). Second, we observed enhanced activation in several posterior parietal areas (e.g., the precuneus and angular gyrus) during anticipation for gains but not losses. The posterior parietal lobe is an important site for spatial awareness and attention.  It is likely that forthcoming rewards in the environments hold a \u201cbottom\u2013up\u201d attentional advantage for people with addiction, who tend to intentionally seek pleasure through taking drugs or gambling. But such activities were not present when they anticipated a losing outcome. This finding seems to suggest that people with addiction allocate more attentional resources to gains than losses. \n\nFurthermore, we observed hypoactivity in the PFC and striatum during both gain and loss anticipation. This was inconsistent with the previous literature, which found robust ventral striatal activities in expectation of both positive and negative outcomes. \u2013  Diminished activity in the reward circuits may indicate impaired reward value updating and adaptive learning. , ,  People with addiction may have difficulty updating the subjective reward value of the substance and consequently require more of the substance to obtain pleasurable effects. This is likely one of the reasons why people with addiction tend to increase drug dosage or administration frequencies over time.  Although we interpreted the hypoactivity during gain anticipation as a result of sensitization processes, we proposed that the striatal hypoactivation during loss anticipation was due to insensitivity to losses in people with addiction. Alternatively, we offer a parsimonious explanation for these results altogether by applying the reward allostasis model again. ,  According to this model, the attenuation of the PFC and striatum is likely a compensatory process for people with addiction to maintain the stability of the reward function. That is, people with addiction allocate more resources from the reward network to addiction-related cues at the expense of its reactivity to non-addiction-related gains and losses. By the same token, in areas involved in early visual processing (i.e., the occipital lobe), activity was strengthened during gain anticipation but attenuated during loss anticipation for people with drug addiction. It is possible that the reduced reactivity of the occipital lobe to anticipatory losses was a compensatory process to reach functional stability of the primary visual cortex. \n\n\n### Conditioning perspective \n  \nIt is worth noting that some of our findings can be explained by the conditioning literature. The experimental tasks used in the included studies (especially monetary incentive delay tasks) encompassed components of both classical conditioning and operant conditioning.  Specifically, a cue that predicted a potential gain or loss can be seen as a conditioned stimulus, while a delivered outcome can be considered an unconditioned stimulus, forming classical conditioning.  Participants\u2019 action during the anticipation phase can then be considered a conditioned response, because it was preceded or triggered by a cue. In the meantime, because the specific value of an outcome (i.e., win $1 or win $0) was contingent on participants\u2019 actions, the response\u2013outcome association formed an operant conditioning in which the outcome could also reinforce participants to adapt their actions to maximize gains and minimize losses. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect brain activity in regions related to both types of conditioning during these gain and loss processing tasks. Indeed, we found lower activation of the striatum during the anticipation phase in people with addiction compared to healthy controls. Previous research has found that the striatum is crucial in human classical and operant conditioning. ,  Hypoactivity in this region may indicate impaired associative learning,  especially punishment-based (e.g., monetary loss) learning,  in people with addiction. As pointed out earlier, the components of classical and operant conditioning are intricately entangled in gain and loss processing paradigms: the cue-outcome association forms a classical conditioning, and the response-outcome association forms an operant conditioning. Moreover, because we contrasted gain and loss responses against a neutral condition or baseline, the effect of conditioning may have been weakened in the extracted data. Consequently, the majority of our findings may not be entirely interpretable under the conditioning framework. Future research can aim at gaining further insights into conditioning in people with addiction by applying established conditioning paradigms. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThere were some limitations in this study. First, the number of included studies on gambling addiction was very small. Because of relatively stringent inclusion criteria, we identified and included only 5 studies on gambling addiction. Thus, we were unable to investigate unique alterations in the brain for people with gambling addiction from the perspective of a meta-analysis. Such a limitation kept us from making conclusive statements about some of the brain activation patterns we observed. For example, was the hyperactivity in the PFC and striatum during loss anticipation indeed driven by the gambling addiction subgroup? Is there any increased activation in the occipital lobe for people with gambling addiction during gain anticipation? Second, only a few studies included in our meta-analysis reported clinical information about the participants (i.e., mean duration of substance use and age of onset of use). As a result, we were unable to conduct regression analysis, which could have revealed if there were any moderating effects of clinical traits on the neural abnormalities. Future research should gain more insight into the altered brain mechanisms in gambling addiction and emphasize the clinical attributes of the patients. Third, some included studies , , ,  controlled for potential confounding variables in their analyses and reported adjusted effect sizes for the peak coordinates (e.g.,   t   values), but the majority of studies did not control for variables of no interest and reported unadjusted statistics. This inconsistency in controlling for confounders and reporting related effect sizes may have had some influence on our findings, but we infer that the effect(s) should be relatively minor because almost all included studies discounted the possibility of potential confounders driving the results by, for instance, matching the participants in advance or conducting correlational analyses between the findings and confounders post hoc. Finally, we included only studies in adults with addiction in our analyses. This was because non-adults, especially adolescents, undergo significant structural and functional changes in reward-related brain regions that are not fully developed until their mid-20s.  It is not yet clear how these changes may influence adolescents\u2019 susceptibility to addictive behaviours.  Moreover, although many adolescents try drugs, only a small group of them transition to substance dependence.  On these grounds, we investigated only adults with addiction. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis meta-analysis revealed several brain regions that showed altered activity during gain and loss processing in adults with addiction. Compared to healthy controls, all addictions showed attenuated activity in the PFC, striatum and insula and enhanced activity in several regions in the default mode network (e.g., the precuneus and angular gyrus) during gain anticipation; enhanced activity in the PFC and conflicting results regarding the striatum (which showed both hyper- and hypoactivation) during loss anticipation; and enhanced activity in the occipital lobe during gain outcome. For the substance dependence subgroup, activity in the occipital lobe was strengthened during gain anticipation but attenuated during loss anticipation. We identified altered brain activity for people with addiction not only in the reward network, but also in regions across the brain, some associated with higher-level functions (i.e., salience network and default mode network) and others associated with lower-level functions (i.e., the primary visual cortex). We also found that people with addiction seemed to be more aroused by and more sensitive to forthcoming gains than losses, demonstrated at both higher-level brain regions (i.e., posterior parietal lobe) and lower-level areas (i.e., the primary visual cortex). Finally and most importantly, we used an allostasis model to explain most of the brain activation patterns in terms of the functional stability of the relevant regions: the reward and salience networks for addiction-related stimuli versus non-addiction-related stimuli, and the occipital lobe for gains versus losses. These results may help us to understand the pathology of gain and loss processing in addiction. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7955844, "text_md5": "ad1013ec2d41f9ea6445c9306bee3485", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 28], "journal": [29, 50], "publication_year": [52, 56], "title": [67, 192], "keywords": [206, 206], "abstract": [219, 2228], "body": [2237, 49500]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33185525, "doi": "10.1503/jpn.200047", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7955844", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7955844"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7955844\">7955844</a>", "list_title": "PMC7955844  A voxel-wise meta-analysis of task-based functional MRI studies on impaired gain and loss processing in adults with addiction"}

We searched the Medline database and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for this purpose and 10 studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. In total, 650 cervical spondylosis myelopathy patients with (+) or without (-) intramedullary signal changes on their T2-weighted images were examined. Weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were used to summarize the data. Patients with focal and faint border changes in the intramedullary signal on T2 magnetic resonance imaging had similar Japanese Orthopaedic Association recovery ratios as those with no signal changes on the magnetic resonance imaging images of the spinal cord did. The surgical outcomes were poorer in the patients with both T2 intramedullary signal changes, especially when the signal changes were multisegmental and had a well-defined border and T1 intramedullary signal changes compared with those without intramedullary signal changes. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging including T1 and T2 imaging can thus be used to predict postoperative recovery in cervical spondylosis myelopathy patients. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nCervical spondylosis is a degenerative disease in which compression of the spinal cord leads to cervical spondylosis myelopathy (CSM) and neurological deficits. The most common clinical symptoms are gait disturbance, upper limb paresthesias or sensory disturbance and clumsy hands. Intramedullary signal changes (ISCs) in the spinal cord on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in cervical compression myelopathy are deemed to reflect pathologic changes in the spinal cord and are regarded as an indicator of the prognosis  . Nonetheless, as the cause and the pathogenesis of signal intensity changes within the spinal cord remain unclear, the significance of the signal intensity changes for prognosis remains controversial  , ,. We thus conducted the present meta-analysis to compare postoperative functional outcomes in CSM patients according to T2-weighted and T1-weighted MRI images. \n\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS \n  \n### Search strategy and inclusion criteria \n  \nA literature search was performed up to June 2013 using the Medline database and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We screened all fields by combining the terms \u201ccervical spondylotic myelopathy\u201d, \u201ccervical spondylotic\u201d, \u201ccervical compression myelopathy\u201d or \u201cCSM\u201d and \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cMRI\u201d. The articles selected were limited to those published in English. A comprehensive search of the reference lists of both the retrieved articles and previous published reviews was also conducted to ensure inclusion of all possible articles. \n\nThe following inclusion criteria were used: 1. the study population consisted of patients with CSM who underwent surgery via an anterior, posterior,or combined approach; 2. MRI, including T2-weighted and T1-weighted images, was performed before surgery for all patients; 3. the clinical grade of the CSM was evaluated according to the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score for cervical myelopathy before surgery and at the final follow-up, and the postoperative functional assessment was based on the JOA recovery ratio (RR); 4. the study had a comparative design; and 5. the follow-up duration was >6 months. All potential articles were separately reviewed by two authors (X.G.H. and C.H.). Any divergences between the investigators were resolved by discussion. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nData were collected according to the following categories, where available: 1. basic characteristics, including study design, publication year, inclusion/exclusion criteria, patient age, enrolled number, disease course, surgical modalities and follow-up duration; 2. imaging assessment, consisting of classification of the spinal cord signal pattern; and 3. clinical symptoms, recovery rate, and pre- and postoperative JOA scores. Inconsistencies were resolved through discussion until a consensus was reached. \n\n\n### Assessment of risk of bias \n  \nThe studies included in the current analysis were all non-randomized, and we used the MINORS score to assess the risk of bias  . The main items for MINORS include prospective collection of data, a follow-up period appropriate to the aim of the study, unbiased assessment of the study endpoint, loss to follow-up of less than 5%, baseline equivalence of the groups and adequate statistical analyses. A maximum score of 24 points can be generated for each included comparative study. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis \n  \nIn our study, the postoperative JOA RR was used as an evaluation index. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to summarize the data. The level of significance was set at   p  <0.05. The   \u03c7   test and   I   statistic (considered significant when the   p   value for the   \u03c7   test is <0.10 or   I   >50%) were performed to evaluate heterogeneity. Fixed-effect models were applied when the statistical heterogeneity was significant and a random-effect model was applied when the heterogeneity was not significant. Funnel plots were employed to assess the potential publication bias. The analysis was performed using the statistical software Review Manager Version 5.0 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Literature search \n  \nThe search strategy ( ) identified 430 potential studies from the Medline database and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. In total, 413 papers were excluded according to our inclusion criteria. Among those excluded papers, 8 studies used the modified JOA (mJOA) RR, the Neck Disability Index (NDI), and the Nurick grade to estimate the surgical outcome; for these studies, we performed a descriptive analysis. Seven additional studies were excluded from the analysis because of redundant publication or incomplete data. Therefore, 10 articles were ultimately included  ,. \n\n\n### Assessment of risk of bias \n  \nAll of the eligible articles were non-randomized and the MINORS score was used to assess the risk of bias. The scores varied from 16 to 21 ( ). Considering the previously published papers scoring >75% of the maximum score  , designated as high quality, there were eight high-quality articles. \n\n\n### Study characteristics \n  \nBasic information on the included articles is presented in  . Of the 10 studies, 4 did not provide any data about disease course  , , , , and 1 did not mention the mean follow-up duration  . The postoperative JOA RR was used to estimate the surgical outcome in all selected studies. \n\n\n### T2-weighted MRI ISCs (+)   versus   ISCs (-) \n  \nIn the 10 studies, 466 patients were included in the T2-weighted image ISCs (+) group and 184 were included in the T2-weighted image ISCs (-) group. Overall, the WMD was statistically significant (WMD=-13.10,   p  <0.00001, 95% CI: -18.86 to -7.33) in favor of the ISCs (-) group. The forest plot showed there was statistically significant heterogeneity (  I  =54%,   p  =0.02) ( ). \n\n\n### Subgroup analysis \n  \nThree studies divided the T2 hyperintensity changes into focal and multisegmental changes  , , . The WMD was equivalent for the focal and normal groups (WMD=1.75,   p  =0.70, 95% CI: -7.32 to 10.83). Statistical heterogeneity was not detected among the studies (  I  =0%,   p  =0.61). Compared with the normal group, pooled estimates showed that the multisegmental group achieved a significantly poorer surgical outcome (WMD=-26.36,   p  =0.0008, 95% CI: -41.76 to -10.95). Statistically significant heterogeneity was clearly present (  I  =66%,   p=  0.05) ( ). \n\nRelevant data about faint and well-defined border signal intensity changes on T2-weighted images were documented in three articles  , , . Overall, there was no significant difference between the faint border and the normal groups (WMD=-4.44,   p  =0.51, 95% CI:-17.71 to 8.82). Significant heterogeneity was detected (  I  =70%,   p  =0.04). Compared with the normal group, pooled data indicated a poorer surgical outcome in the well-defined border group (WMD=-23.93,   p  <0.00001, 95% CI: -31.75 to -16.12). There was no evidence of statistically significant heterogeneity   (I  =0%,   p  =0.71) ( ). \n\nOf the included studies, only 1 study reported postoperative JOA RRs for patients with low signal intensity changes on T1-weighted images  . The data revealed that this group had a poorer prognosis (WMD=-41.60,   p  =0.008, 95% CI: -72.31 to -10.89). \n\n\n### Descriptive analysis \n  \nEight studies used the mJOA RR, the NDI and the Nurick grade to estimate the surgical outcome; for these studies, we performed a descriptive analysis  ,. Six records studied both T1 and T2 ISCs and 2 records only studied T2 ISCs. The conclusions were that both T2 ISCs and especially the signal changes that were multisegmental and intense and T1 ISCs indicated a poor prognosis ( ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nAccording to previous studies, signal intensity changes in the spinal cord on MRI images could reflect pathologic changes. Due to advances in MRI techniques and software, we can now detect various degrees of signal intensity changes in CSM patients. Recently, a correlation between MRI findings and clinical recovery after therapy has been widely discussed  , 16 25 . However, at the same time, no significant difference in MRI parameters has been noted. We believed that comparison between previous articles would be meaningful. \n\nSince Takahashi et al.   first described high signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI of the spinal cord in patients with CSM, many studies have investigated the association between high-intensity signal changes on T2-weighted images and surgical outcomes. However, the prognostic value of ISCs on T2-weighted MRI remains controversial: several authors  , , ,  observed that ISCs were not related to poor outcomes in patients with CSM, whereas others  ,  reported that patients with ISCs had a poor prognosis after surgery. Our meta-analysis revealed that patients with ISCs on T2-weighted images had a poorer outcome compared with patients with no signal intensity changes. \n\nIn certain studies, the signal changes were further subdivided. Wada et al.   divided patients with ISCs on T2-weighted MRI into two groups according to the level involved: one group had ISCs located at one level and one group had ISCs that extended into two or more levels. The authors found that patients with multisegmental ISCs tended to have poorer outcomes and that those with focal ISCs had a similar outcome as those without ISCs. Chen et al.   proposed another classification, subdividing ISCs on T2-weighted MRI into two patterns: ISCs with a faint, light border and ISCs with an intense, well-defined border. Light ISCs reflected mild neuropathologic alteration in the spinal cord and greater recuperative potential, whereas intense ISCs reflected severe alteration and less recuperative potential. It seemed that only intense ISCs corresponded to a poor prognosis. Our meta-analysis revealed that multisegmental and intense ISCs indicated worse surgical outcomes than focal and light ISCs did. \n\nMany studies have investigated the significance of low signal intensity on T1-weighted MRI, which is considered to reflect pathologically irreversible changes  , , . Fernandes de Rota et al.   reported that low signal intensity changes presented only in patients who had already had high T2 signal intensity changes and most of the changes were multisegmental. Morio et al.   found that low signal intensity changes on T1-weighted sequences indicated a poor prognosis and that high signal intensity changes on T2-weighted sequences reflected a broad spectrum of spinal cord recuperative potential. \n\nOther factors, such as the age at the time of the operation, symptom duration, narrowing of the spinal canal and preoperative cervical lordosis, have been reported to influence the surgical outcome in patients with CSM  . Moreover, Arvin et al.   revealed that findings on postoperative MRI were of predictive value in determining outcomes in CSM patients. \n\nThere are several limitations in the present meta-analysis. First, the best evidence consists of a meta-analysis of numerous randomized controlled trials with high quality, but 10 articles included in this study were non-randomized. Second, heterogeneity was detected among the studies when we pooled the outcomes. This heterogeneity could be explained by the various study qualities, study designs and patient baseline data. Third, we only discussed the significance of preoperative MRI imaging in predicting postoperative recovery, but many other factors related to surgical outcomes were not strictly controlled. Thus, further larger-sample trials with high study quality will still be essential to clarify the prognostic value of MRI signal changes in patients with CMS. \n\nIn summary, the results of this meta-analysis showed that the postoperative JOA RR was poor in patients with both intramedullary signal intensity changes on T2-weighted MRI of the spinal cord, especially when the ISCs were multisegmental, had a well-defined border and were intense, and low signal intensity on T1-weighted MRI. In summary, preoperative MRI imaging can be used to predict postoperative recovery in patients with CSM. \n\n\n## COMMENTS \n  \nAs the cause and the pathogenesis of signal intensity changes within the spinal cord remain unclear, the significance of the signal intensity changes for prognosis remains controversial. This meta-analysis was thus performed to elucidate whether preoperative signal intensity changes could predict surgical outcomes in patients with cervical spondylosis myelopathy on the basis of T2-weighted and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging images. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nChen H was responsible for the study design and the manuscript preparation.

Thus, tau-PET may allow precision-medicine prediction of individual tau-related cognitive trajectories, which can be important for determining patient-specific cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. Here, we aimed to examine whether tau-PET in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions, identified via fMRI meta-analyses, allows the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline. Further, we aimed to determine whether tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites capture patient-specific cognitive trajectories more sensitively than conventional cognitive measures. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe included Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants classified as controls (i.e., amyloid-negative, cognitively normal,   n   = 121) or Alzheimer\u2019s disease-spectrum (i.e., amyloid-positive, cognitively normal to dementia,   n   = 140), plus 111 AVID-1451-A05 participants for independent validation (controls/Alzheimer\u2019s disease-spectrum=46/65). All participants underwent baseline  F-flortaucipir tau-PET, amyloid-PET, and longitudinal cognitive testing to assess annual cognitive changes (i.e., episodic memory, language, executive functioning, visuospatial). Cognitive changes were calculated using linear mixed models. Independent meta-analytical task-fMRI activation maps for each included cognitive domain were obtained from the Neurosynth database and applied to tau-PET to determine tau-PET signal in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions. In bootstrapped linear regression, we assessed the strength of the relationship (i.e., partial   R  ) between cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET vs. global or temporal-lobe tau-PET and cognitive changes. Further, we used tau-PET-based prediction of domain-specific decline to compose personalized cognitive composites that were tailored to capture patient-specific cognitive decline. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nIn both amyloid-positive cohorts (ADNI [age = 75.99\u00b17.69] and A05 [age = 74.03\u00b19.03]), cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET outperformed global and temporal-lobe tau-PET for predicting future cognitive decline in episodic memory, language, executive functioning, and visuospatial abilities. Further, a tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite across cognitive domains enhanced the sensitivity to assess cognitive decline in amyloid-positive subjects, yielding lower sample sizes required for detecting simulated intervention effects compared to conventional cognitive endpoints (i.e., memory composite, global cognitive composite). However, the latter effect was less strong in A05 compared to the ADNI cohort. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nCombining tau-PET with task-fMRI-derived maps of major cognitive domains facilitates the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline. This approach may help to increase the sensitivity to detect Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related cognitive decline and to determine personalized cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13195-022-01105-5. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau pathology ensuing neurodegeneration and cognitive decline [ ,  ]. While neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers of A\u03b2 and tau are routinely established for AD diagnosis [ ,  ], reliable prognosis of cognitive decline remains a critical challenge, which is further complicated by the considerable heterogeneity in symptom manifestation and disease progression [ \u2013 ]. \n\nAccurate prediction of cognitive decline in AD will be, however, particularly important for clinical trials to (i) stratify patients by progression risk and/or (ii) determine patient-specific clinical endpoints that allow sensitive assessment of heterogeneous cognitive trajectories within trial-typical 1\u20132-year follow-ups [ ,  ,  ]. Elevated tau-PET is closely associated with the development of cognitive deficits in AD, and recent studies also support tau-PET as a promising prognostic marker for cognitive decline, outperforming the prognostic accuracy of amyloid-PET and MRI-assessed neurodegeneration [ \u2013 ]. Specifically, elevated tau-PET has been associated with faster global cognitive decline and clinical conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia [ ,  ,  ,  ]. Moreover, cross-sectional studies reported that tau-PET patterns closely mirror clinical AD heterogeneity, including occipital tau-PET in posterior cortical atrophy (i.e., visual-variant AD), left-hemispheric tau-PET in language-variant AD, and mesial-temporal-lobe tau in amnestic AD [ ,  ]. This suggests a strong clinico-pathological correspondence between symptom manifestation and tau-PET patterns. Thus, mapping tau-PET to brain networks associated with cognitive domains typically affected in AD may allow the prediction of cognitive-domain-specific decline, to facilitate the assessment of patient-specific cognitive trajectories in clinical trials targeting tau pathology [ ]. \n\nTo test this, we obtained data from two independent cohorts from the Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI,   N   = 261) and the A05 cohort (  N   = 111) covering healthy controls (i.e., cognitively normal A\u03b2\u2212) and AD-spectrum patients (i.e., A\u03b2+) with baseline flortaucipir tau-PET and amyloid-PET. Further, all participants were characterized on different cognitive domains including episodic memory (MEM), language (LAN), executive functioning (EF), and visuospatial abilities (VS) across ~1.5\u20132 years of follow-up, which matches follow-up periods of several recent phase 2b&3 clinical trials (e.g., EMERGE/ENGAGE) [ ]. To assess the association between tau-PET and cognitive-domain-specific decline, we obtained meta-analytical maps of task-fMRI studies from Neurosynth [ ,  ] to determine brain regions that are consistently associated with MEM/LAN/EF/VS across ~1900 task-fMRI studies. We then mapped patient-specific tau-PET to cognitive-domain-specific brain activation maps and tested whether determining baseline tau-PET in regions involved in a given cognitive domain improves the prediction of cognitive-domain-specific decline compared to conventional tau-PET metrics (i.e., global/temporal-lobe tau-PET standardized uptake value ratios [SUVRs]) that have been suggested as prognostic markers in AD [ ,  ]. Lastly, we used tau-PET predicted domain-specific decline to compute patient-specific weighted cognitive composites, which we hypothesized to capture individual tau-related cognitive trajectories more sensitively than commonly used cognitive outcomes. Using simulated interventions, we then tested whether tau-PET-informed cognitive composites (i.e., personalized endpoints) [ ] improve the sensitivity to detect treatment effects compared to conventional cognitive scores. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n#### ADNI \n  \nWe included 261 ADNI participants (inclusion criteria:  ) based on the availability of  F-florbetapir/ F-florbetaben amyloid-PET,  F-flortaucipir tau-PET, longitudinal cognitive assessments (>1 follow-up), demographics (age, sex, education), clinical status, and APOE genotyping. All baseline data were obtained within 6 months; clinical status was classified by ADNI investigators as cognitively normal (CN, Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] \u2265 24, Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] = 0, non-depressed), MCI (MMSE \u2265 24, CDR\u00a0=\u00a00.5, objective memory-impairment on education-adjusted Wechsler Memory Scale II, preserved activities of daily living), or demented (MMSE = 20\u201326, CDR \u2265 0.5, NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD). Subjects with non-AD-related cognitive impairment (i.e., A\u03b2\u2212 MCI/dementia) were excluded. Subjects were classified as APOE4 risk allele carriers when at least one \u03b54 allele was detected. Ethics approval was obtained by ADNI investigators; all study participants provided written informed consent. \n\n\n#### A05 \n  \nA total of 111 participants were selected from the AVID-1451-A05 phase 2/3 trial (NCT02016560; inclusion criteria:  ), based on the availability of  F-florbetapir amyloid-PET,  F-flortaucipir tau-PET, longitudinal cognitive assessments (\u2265 1follow-up), demographics (age, sex), clinical status, and APOE genotyping. Continuous measures on years of education were not available for all participants and thus not included. All baseline data were obtained within 30 days. Participants were classified as CN (MMSE \u2265 29, no history of cognitive impairment), MCI (24 \u2264 MMSE < 29, showing MCI according to NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines) [ ], and AD dementia (10 < MMSE < 24, showing possible or probable AD based on NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines) [ ]. As for ADNI, subjects with non-AD-related cognitive impairment (i.e., A\u03b2\u2212 MCI/dementia) were excluded. Subjects were classified as APOE4 risk allele carriers when at least one \u03b54 allele was detected. The study was approved by the clinical investigator\u2019s local Institutional Review Board; all participants provided written informed consent. \n\n\n\n### fMRI meta-analyses of cognitive-domain-specific brain activation and tau-PET assessments \n  \nTo determine tau-PET in regions that are critical for a given cognitive domain (i.e., MEM/LAN/EF/VS), we obtained meta-analytical brain activation maps from task-based fMRI studies from Neurosynth ( , see Additional file  : Methods) using the search terms:   episodic memory   (included studies,   N   = 332),   language   (included studies,   N   = 1101),   executive control   (included studies,   N   = 230), and   visuospatial   (included studies,   N   = 267). Methodological details on Neurosynth-based meta-analyses have been described previously (see  ) [ ]. Cognitive-domain-specific meta-analytical task-fMRI maps were binarized and masked with cortical gray matter to exclude typical tau-PET off-target binding regions (i.e., hippocampus/subcortex) [ ,  ] and applied to spatially normalized SUVR-transformed tau-PET images to extract tau-PET signal within cognitive-domain-specific brain regions (for details on PET acquisition and preprocessing see Additional file  : Methods). To further minimize influences of flortaucipir off-target binding, we used voxel-wise two-component Gaussian-mixture-modeling to transform SUVRs to tau-positivity probabilities (TPP) [ ,  ]. Repeating this procedure for each task-fMRI map yielded cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET signals for MEM/LAN/EF/VS (Fig.  A, B (I)). To compare the accuracy of cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET for predicting cognitive trajectories against conventional tau-PET measures, we obtained global and temporal-lobe tau-PET SUVRs, which have been previously shown to capture AD-related tau accumulation and predict cognitive decline [ ,  ,  ,  ]. For global tau-PET, we determined average neocortical tau-PET, while excluding typical off-target binding regions (hippocampus, subcortex, cerebellum [ ,  ]; Fig.  B (II)). The temporal-lobe ROI included Braak-stage ROIs 1, 3, and 4 (Fig.  B (II)) [ ,  ].   \nGeneration of meta-analytical task-fMRI maps for assessing cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET (  A  ), surface rendering of regions of interests (ROIs) applied to tau-PET (  B  ), and analysis flowchart (  C  ). First, we compared the predictive accuracy of global tau-PET, temporal tau-PET, and cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET for predicting future cognitive decline using bootstrapped linear regressions. Note that separate regression models were run for each tau-PET ROI   (CI)  . Second, we ran 1000 bootstrapped linear regression models in ADNI A\u03b2+ and extracted beta values for each variable of the regression model (  CII  ), which were later used for assessing patient-specific cognitive composites in both ADNI A\u03b2+ and A05 A\u03b2+ (  CIII  ). Specifically, we applied the 1000 bootstrapped linear model equations to subject level data to determine predicted cognitive change rates for each A\u03b2+ subject of the ADNI and A05 sample. Based on the rank of the predicted cognitive change rates, we then determined a tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite. Abbreviations: DV, dependent variable; IV, independent variable; CV, control variable; CR, change rate \n  \n\n\n### Assessment of cognitive changes \n  \nFor both samples, we obtained composites of MEM/LAN/EF/VS to assess cognitive-domain-specific changes. In ADNI, we used pre-established composites including ADNI-MEM [ ], ADNI-LAN, ADNI-EF, and ADNI-VS ( ) [ ]. In A05, we generated composites (i.e., A05-MEM, A05-LAN, A05-EF, A05-VS) based on available cognitive tests using a pre-established approach (see Additional file  : Methods, Table S1) [ ,  ]. For each cognitive composite and cohort, annual cognitive changes were determined by fitting linear mixed models with cognitive composites as the dependent variable and time (i.e., years from baseline) as the independent variable, with subject-specific random slope and intercept [ ,  ]. Thereby, we derived subject-specific annual cognitive change rates for each cognitive domain. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nAll analyses were computed using R statistical software version 4.0.2 ( ). \n\nDifferences in baseline characteristics between diagnostic groups were tested using ANOVAs for continuous and chi-squared tests for categorical data. \n\nTo compare the accuracy of different tau-PET ROIs (i.e., cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal, Fig.  B) for predicting cognitive decline, we performed bootstrapped linear regression with 1000 iterations per cognitive domain and tau-PET ROI. Within each iteration, cognitive changes on MEM/LAN/EF/VS were included as dependent variables, and tau-PET ROIs (i.e., cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal) as independent variables. For ADNI, all models were controlled for age, sex, education, clinical status, APOE4 status, and baseline performance of the respective cognitive composite. For A05, continuous measures of education were not consistently available; hence, models were corrected for age, sex, clinical status, APOE4 status, and baseline performance of the respective cognitive composite. In each iteration, resulting partial   R   values (variance explained in cognitive change) of the respective tau-PET ROI were extracted. The resulting partial   R   distributions of the different ROIs were then compared using paired t-tests and standardized differences were calculated using Cohen\u2019s   d  . In addition, 95% confidence intervals (CI) of bootstrapped partial   R   distributions were determined for non-parametric comparisons. Main analyses were conducted in AD-spectrum patients (i.e., A\u03b2+) and exploratorily repeated in the pooled CN A\u03b2\u2212 plus AD-spectrum sample (Fig.  C (I)). \n\nNext, we aimed to determine patient-specific cognitive composites that are informed by the baseline tau-PET-based prediction of cognitive decline, using ADNI as a discovery sample and A05 as a validation sample. Within ADNI A\u03b2+, we ran 1000 bootstrapped regressions controlled for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status to extract 1000 beta-values of the association between cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET and cognitive changes (i.e., ADNI-MEM/ADNI-LAN/ADNI-EF/ADNI-VS) for each variable of the regression model (Fig.  C (II)). Note, that the cognitive composites which were used for building the model (e.g., ADNI-MEM) included slightly differed tests than the cognitive composites of the validation cohort (e.g., A05-MEM), ensuring additional generalizability of the model and independence from specific tests for MEM/LAN/EF/VS. \n\nNext, we entered patient-specific baseline data of both ADNI (i.e., discovery) and A05 (i.e., validation) subjects in the 1000 linear model equations to determine mean patient-specific estimates of cognitive decline. To generate a personalized cognitive composite, we computed squared ranks of predicted cognitive changes across MEM/LAN/EF/VS for each subject (i.e., from 1 =slowest predicted decline up to 4 =fastest predicted decline), in order to maximize the information weight of cognitive domains with fast predicted cognitive decline. For each subject, cognitive changes (see the \u201cAssessment of cognitive changes\u201d section) were then weighted by the tau-PET informed squared rank (i.e., 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ; see Fig.  C (III)) to determine a weighted, personalized cognitive composite that summarizes cognitive changes based on the degree of tau-PET-predicted cognitive decline. Using a paired   t  -test, we then tested whether tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites show stronger cognitive changes compared to conventional cognitive composites that average all cognitive domains. \n\nLastly, we exploratorily tested whether tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites are more sensitive for detecting treatment effects compared to conventional measures of global cognition and memory. To that end, we simulated interventions by attenuating cognitive changes by 20/30/40% and calculated required sample sizes for detecting simulated intervention effects using the R-package   pwr   (settings: two-sample   t  -test, comparing actual vs. attenuated cognitive changes; two-tailed, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8; see  ). This analysis was performed for tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites, an unweighted cognitive composite (i.e.,   z  -score mean across actual change rates of ADNI/A05-MEM/LAN/EF/VS), as well as actual change rates of MEM (ADNI-MEM/A05-MEM) [ ]. The latter one was selected, since episodic memory decline is one of the hallmark cognitive symptoms in AD as extensively reported before [ \u2013 ]. The analyses were repeated in the ADNI and A05 AD spectrum groups excluding APOE4 status as a covariate to test whether our models also apply in more simple settings without APOE genotype availability (see Additional file   [ADNI:   n   = 149; A05:   n   = 67]). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Sample characteristics \n  \nWe included 183/53/25 CN/MCI/demented ADNI subjects (age = 74.89\u00b17.48 years) and 51/35/25 CN/MCI/demented A05 individuals (age = 71.29\u00b110.03 years). Descriptive statistics stratified by cohort, clinical status, and amyloid status are shown in Table  . Group-mean tau-PET SUVRs are shown in Additional file  : Fig. S1.   \nSubjects characteristics \n  \nIn ADNI CN: MMSE \u2265 24, CDR = 0, non-depressed; MCI: MMSE \u2265 24, CDR = 0.5, objective memory-impairment on education-adjusted Wechsler Memory Scale II, preserved activities of daily living; demented: MMSE = 20\u201326, CDR \u2265 0.5, NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD \n\nIn A05 CN: MMSE \u2265 29, no history of cognitive impairment; MCI: 24 \u2264 MMSE < 29, showing MCI according to NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines; demented: 10 < MMSE < 24, showing possible or probable AD based on NIA-AA working group\u2019s diagnostic guidelines \n\nValues are presented as mean (SD);   p  -values were derived from ANOVAs for continuous measures and from chi-squared tests for categorical measures \n\n MEM  , episodic memory composite score;   LAN  , language composite score;   EF  , executive functioning composite score;   VS  , visuospatial composite score \n\nMean values significantly (  p   < 0.05, post-hoc tests) different from: \n\nCN A\u03b2  \u2212  \n\nCN A\u03b2+ \n\nMCI A\u03b2+ \n\nDementia A\u03b2+ \n  \n\n\n### Cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET outperforms conventional tau-PET metrics for predicting domain-specific cognitive decline \n  \nFirst, we determined the accuracy of cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET vs. global and temporal-lobe tau-PET for predicting future decline in MEM/LAN/EF/VS. In ADNI A\u03b2+, bootstrapped linear regression revealed cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET as a better predictor of cognitive decline than global/temporal tau-PET for MEM (cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.175/0.108/0.152; Fig.  A), LAN (cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.201/0.164/0.136; Fig.  B), EF (cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.132/0.088/0.029; Fig.  C), and VS (cognitive-domain-specific/global/temporal tau-PET: partial   R   = 0.192/0.097/0.070; Fig.  D). Further, 95%CIs did not overlap between bootstrapped partial   R  -distributions of the cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET and global/temporal tau-PET ROIs, providing non-parametric support that cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET explains more variance in cognitive decline than conventional tau-PET measures (Fig.  A\u2013D). Congruent results were obtained for the A05 A\u03b2+ validation cohort for all cognitive tests (Fig.  E\u2013H). Detailed results of bootstrapped regressions are provided in Additional file  : Tables S2&3. When repeating these analyses in the pooled CN A\u03b2\u2212 plus A\u03b2+ sample, we obtained largely congruent results in both cohorts except for LAN in A05 (Additional file  : Table S3). Using SUVRs rather than Gaussian mixture model transformed tau-PET signal of the cognitive-domain-specific ROI yielded consistent results except for ADNI-MEM and ADNI/A05-LAN (see Additional file  : Table S4&5). The results remained consistent when excluding APOE4 status as covariate from the model (Additional file  : Table S6-10 and Figure S2). Together, these findings suggest that combining tau-PET with meta-analytical task-fMRI maps of major cognitive functions improves the prediction of domain-specific cognitive decline compared to conventional global/temporal-lobe tau-PET measures in AD.   \nBootstrapped linear models (1000 iterations) revealed that partial   R   values (explained variance in annual cognitive changes) were higher for cognitive-domain-specific tau than for global or temporal tau-PET. The boxplots illustrate the partial   R   distributions for episodic memory, language, executive functioning, and visuospatial abilities within the AD-spectrum (ADNI cohort:   A  \u2013  D  ; A05 cohort:   E  \u2013  H  ). The models were controlled for age, sex [in ADNI: education], clinical status, baseline score of the respective cognitive test, and APOE4 status.   R  -distributions across different regions of interests (global vs. temporal vs. cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET) were compared with paired t-tests. 95% confidence intervals for the mean are displayed as horizontal lines. Within each panel, the tau-PET ROI with the highest explained variance is highlighted by an underscore. *  p   < 0.05, **  p   < 0.01, ***  p   < 0.001 \n  \n\n\n### A tau-PET-informed cognitive composite increases the sensitivity to assess cognitive decline \n  \nNext, we used tau-PET-based prediction of cognitive decline to determine personalized cognitive composites to better capture individual tau-related cognitive trajectories. Specifically, we ran 1000 bootstrapped regression models in ADNI A\u03b2+ (i.e., discovery sample) to determine beta-estimates for the association between cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET and cognitive decline, controlling for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status. To derive patient-specific estimates for cognitive decline in ADNI A\u03b2+, we then entered individual tau-PET measures and covariates in bootstrapped linear model equations to determine mean estimates for cognitive decline. For each subject, we then square-ranked the resulting cognitive change rates on the four cognitive domains (i.e., from 1 =slowest predicted cognitive decline up to 4 =fastest predicted cognitive decline), to determine a rank-weighted cognitive composite that maximizes the information-weight of those cognitive domains in which cognitive decline is expected based on baseline tau-PET. The same linear model equations derived from ADNI A\u03b2+ were then applied to A05 A\u03b2+ for validation. In addition, we determined an \u201cunweighted\u201d cognitive composite as the average   z  -score across all four cognitive domains. We found that the tau-PET-informed patient-specific cognitive composite showed faster longitudinal decline than the unweighted cognitive composite in ADNI A\u03b2+ (  T   = 20.442,   p   < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 1.728) but not in A05 A\u03b2+ (  T   = \u22121.423,   p   = 0.160, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.176; Fig.  ). When repeating the analysis excluding APOE4 status as covariate, we found a faster longitudinal decline of the tau-PET-informed patient-specific cognitive composite in ADNI (  T   = 15.624,   p   < 0.001, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 1.280) and in A05 (  T   = 2.758,   p   = 0.008, Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.337; Additional file  : Figure S3).   \nComparison of unweighted (i.e., average of MEM/LAN/EF/VS) and tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites for AD-spectrum patients (i.e., A\u03b2+) within the ADNI cohort (  A  ) and the A05 cohort (  B  ). Statistics were derived from paired   t  -tests. The model for the tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites was controlled for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status \n  \n\n\n### Patient-centered cognitive composites can reduce the sample sizes to detect treatment effects in clinical trials \n  \nLastly, we exploratorily assessed whether using tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites as an endpoint in clinical trials increases the sensitivity to detect intervention effects. To this end, we compared estimated sample sizes for simulated intervention effects (i.e., 20/30/40% attenuated cognitive decline) for different cognitive endpoints in A\u03b2+. Specifically, we calculated estimated sample sizes for MEM (ADNI-MEM/A05-MEM), as well as unweighted (i.e., mean across ADNI/A05-MEM/LAN/VIS/EF) and tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites. Across both the ADNI discovery and A05 validation sample, tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites required the lowest number of participants to detect intervention effects for all intervention strengths, although effects were stronger in ADNI (Table  ). Although no significant differences were found between the unweighted and the tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composite in A05, our finding that the personalized cognitive composite required the lowest sample sizes also in the A05 cohort suggests that personalized cognitive composites assess cognitive change over time more sensitively than cognitive composites that are agnostic for patient-specific tau-dependent cognitive trajectories. When repeating the analysis without APOE4 as covariate, the results remained consistent, showing the lowest required sample sizes when applying the personalized cognitive composite for both cohorts (Additional file  : Table 11).   \nSample size estimation to detect simulated intervention effects of 20%, 30%, and 40% in AD-spectrum patients. The model for the tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites was controlled for age, sex, clinical status, and APOE4 status \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur first finding was that mapping baseline tau-PET to meta-analytical task-fMRI brain activation maps of MEM/LAN/EF/VS facilitates personalized prediction of tau-related cognitive trajectories in AD. Specifically, we found tau-PET in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions to predict domain-specific cognitive decline better than conventional tau-PET metrics (i.e., global/temporal-lobe tau-PET) which have been previously shown to be prognostic markers in AD [ ,  ]. Second, we showed that using cognitive-domain-specific tau-PET as an information source to determine patient-tailored cognitive composites improves the sensitivity to assess AD-related cognitive decline compared to conventional cognitive composites. In exploratory simulated interventions, we showed further that using tau-PET-informed personalized composites as cognitive endpoints may reduce sample sizes required to detect tau-targeting treatment effects compared to conventional endpoints (e.g., MEM, global composites). Together, our independently validated findings suggest that combining tau-PET with fMRI-based mapping of cognitive abilities can facilitate the prediction of AD-related cognitive trajectories, which may improve patient-specific assessments of cognitive changes in clinical trials that target tau pathology. \n\nFirst, we reported that applying task-fMRI maps of MEM/LAN/EF/VS to tau-PET in AD patients improves the prediction of cognitive-domain-specific decline compared to conventional prognostic tau-PET readouts [ ,  ]. We specifically focused on these cognitive domains since they are typically assessed in cognitive test protocols for evaluating AD in standard clinical settings and clinical trials [ ,  ,  ]. Our findings critically extend previous cross-sectional AD studies, emphasizing a close link between spatially heterogeneous patterns of tau deposition and neurodegeneration with heterogeneous symptom manifestation [ ,  ,  ]. Since tau pathology has been shown to disrupt neuronal connectivity in preclinical [ ] and clinical studies [ \u2013 ], neurotoxic tau may drive network dysfunction [ ] and impairment in the cognitive domain that is supported by the tau-affected network. Supporting this, we found that higher tau-PET in brain regions that support a given cognitive domain [ ,  ] is associated with faster decline in that cognitive domain. While the current study investigated tau-PET as a predictor of cognitive decline for a selected set of cognitive domains typically affected in AD [ ] our proposed methodological framework can be applied for mapping tau-PET to other cognitive or non-cognitive domains, which may motivate future efforts to investigate tau-PET for predicting patient-centered disease trajectories in AD. \n\nSecond, we show that combining baseline tau-PET with task-fMRI maps of MEM/LAN/EF/VS allows determining personalized cognitive composites with increased sensitivity to detect patient-specific cognitive decline compared to conventional patient-agnostic cognitive composites. Specifically, we used baseline tau-PET signal in cognitive-domain-specific brain regions to forecast domain-specific cognitive decline. To compute a personalized composite, the actual cognitive change rates with faster tau-PET-predicted decline were weighted higher than actual change rates with slower tau-PET-predicted cognitive decline. Such patient-specific cognitive composites take into account inter-individual variability to facilitate longitudinal assessment of heterogeneous cognitive trajectories [ \u2013 ] and may thus be applied as personalized endpoints in clinical trials [ ,  ]. Supporting this, we exploratorily performed simulated trials in which tau-PET-informed personalized cognitive composites increased the sensitivity to detect treatment effects compared to conventional composites, which have been previously used as endpoints in clinical trials [ ,  ]. However, it should be noted that effects on estimated sample sizes for simulated intervention effects were smaller in A05 than in ADNI, potentially due to differences in cognitive tests used to obtain cognitive composites, differences in baseline scores, differences in the overall clinical characteristics between datasets, differences in frequency of amnestic versus non-amnestic phenotypes, APOE4 frequencies, or different data processing strategies. Despite small effect sizes, results were consistent across both samples; hence, our approach for assessing personalized composites may be a starting point for improving the assessment of heterogeneous cognitive trajectories to reduce sample sizes in clinical trials. Nevertheless, it will be important to replicate our findings across larger studies with harmonized data assessment and clinical characteristics. \n\nA clear strength of the present study is the independent validation across two cohorts with different cognitive assessment protocols. Although sample sizes were smaller in the A05 cohort and effects less strong than in ADNI, the congruent results between both cohorts highlighted the robustness of our findings. Nevertheless, several limitations should be highlighted. First, flortaucipir shows off-target binding within hippocampal and subcortical areas [ ]. Although these regions were a priori excluded, and Gaussian-mixture modeling was performed to further eliminate off-target binding [ ,  ], our results warrant further replication with second-generation tau-PET with an improved off-target binding profile. Second, brain regions like the hippocampus are critical for cognitive function (e.g., memory); hence, second-generation tau-PET which allows hippocampal assessments [ ] may further improve the prediction of cognitive decline beyond what is currently possible with flortaucipir. Third, all analyses were determined across the entire AD spectrum. Here, it will be critical to investigate the predictive accuracy of tau-PET for cognitive decline across different clinical groups once larger datasets become available. This will be particularly important for assessing the potential of tau-PET for predicting cognitive decline in patients with early AD. Fourth, the included samples show differences in the level of clinical impairment, i.e., the A05 shows lower performance on MMSE than the ADNI sample, which may confound the tau-PET-based prediction when applying the ADNI-trained models to A05 data. Here, it will be an important next step to train and validate our models across datasets which are fully comparable across all measures. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, we demonstrate independently validated evidence for tau-PET combined with fMRI-based mapping of cognitive functions as a promising tool for individualized prediction of cognitive decline in AD. Tau-PET-informed cognitive composites may facilitate detecting intervention effects and thus reduce required sample sizes in clinical trials in AD, which also may be retrospectively assessed in clinical trial data with available tau-PET. \n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9639286, "text_md5": "d0471b7c27b0f3593e4a1eb2c8e3bc6b", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 351], "journal": [352, 371], "publication_year": [373, 377], "title": [388, 504], "keywords": [518, 588], "abstract": [601, 3832], "body": [3841, 34381]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 36345046, "doi": "10.1186/s13195-022-01105-5", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9639286", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9639286"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9639286\">9639286</a>", "list_title": "PMC9639286  Combining tau-PET and fMRI meta-analyses for patient-centered prediction of cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease"}

Prognostic factors play important roles in evaluating the cost of the disease on both individual patients and the social economy. Since there is no exact method to predict MS progression confidently, four general MS phenotypes have been defined: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing\u2010remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), and primary progressive (PPMS). ,   RRMS is the most common MS phenotype. \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive paraclinical test for diagnosis and assessment of disease progression in MS and is often used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. White matter lesions on T2WI are hyperintense and could indicate several different histopathological changes such as edema, inflammation, demyelination, gliosis, and axonal loss.  On the other hand, T1WI hypointense white matter lesions mostly correspond to axonal loss, white matter destruction, axonal loss, and irreversible clinical outcome. ,   As the role of neurodegeneration in the pathophysiology of MS has become more prominent, the formation and evolution of these lesions have been used to measure disease activity. These lesions result from an expansion of the extracellular space due to either an increase in water content or a deterioration of structural components.  This reaction may be the consequence of tissue destruction or increased water influx through the impaired blood\u2010brain barrier. Some variations in these lesions have been identified. As Adusumilli et al. showed, using spin\u2010echo (SE) sequence images, these lesions can be classified based on the levels of the hypointensity to gray holes (less hypointense) and black holes (more hypointense).  These classes are correlated with different clinical and cognitive measures. ,   Sahraian et al. define a black hole as \u201can area that is hypointense compared with the white matter in a T1WI and is concordant with a hyperintense lesion on a T2WI\u201d.  They also propose black holes can be divided into two groups: acute (when it coincides with a contrast\u2010enhancing lesion) and chronic or persistent (those lesions that appear hypointense in T1WI, but do not enhance after contrast injection). Some other authors consider a black hole persistent if it persists for more than 6\u00a0months after its first appearance on MRI. ,   The evolution of T1WI hypointense lesions is also of importance. While some remain unchanged during the time, some other convert to isointense lesions (probably due to extensive or partial remyelination).  In a longitudinal study by van Waesberghe et al. on T1WI, 55% of hypointense lesions converted to isointense lesions by six months, while the rest remained unchanged.  It is also worth mentioning that 25% of the isointense lesions in their patients converted to hypointense lesions after that time interval. \n\nTruyen et al. were the first to describe an association between T1WI hypointense lesions and the clinical state of MS patients.  In their study, when using MRI to evaluate the clinical disability, T1\u00a0hypointense lesion load showed greater cross\u2010sectional and longitudinal  correlations with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) \u00a0scores (a scale extensively used in studies for the assessment of disability for patients with MS) for patients with RRMS or SPMS than did T2\u00a0lesion load. In contrast, some other studies reported an absence of correlations between T1\u00a0hypointensity and EDSS in patients with SPMS ,  ,  ,  ,   and RRMS.  O\u2019Riordan et al. even reported a negative correlation between these measures. \n\nConsidering the importance of these lesions and also considering the controversial findings of their association with the clinical disability of patients, in this review, we aimed to systematically assess the available findings regarding this matter up to this date. \n\n\n### Objectives \n  \nTo evaluate the correlation between T1\u00a0hypointense lesions lesion mean volume on cerebral MRI with disability level of patients with RRMS or SPMS. \n\n\n\n## MATERIAL AND METHODS \n  \nDesign and methods used for this review comply with CRD\u2019s Guidance for Undertaking Reviews in Healthcare  and are reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses 2020 (PRISMA 2020). \n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \nEligibility criteria were informed using the PICOTS system:\n   \n(P) Population: adult patients diagnosed with RRMS or SPMS, based on the McDonald criteria  or Clinically Definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS) based on Poser criteria. \n  \n(I) Index (Prognostic factor): T1\u00a0hypointense lesion mean volume on cerebral MRI. \n  \n(C) Comparator: not applicable. \n  \n(O) Outcome: disability measure using EDSS. \n  \n(T) Timing: measured at the same time MRI was performed (or with a time interval of less than a week in between). \n  \n(S) Setting: any. \n  \n\n\n### Information sources \n  \n#### Online databases \n  \nThe search employed sensitive topic\u2010based strategies designed for each database with no time frame, language, or geographical restrictions. On the 10  of February 2021, AV performed the search in the following databases:\n   \nMEDLINE (PubMed) \n  \nEmbase \n  \nCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials \n  \nWeb of Science (Core Collection) \n  \n\n\n#### Citation searching \n  \nWe also examined the forward and backward citations of the included studies on the 25  of February 2021 using Scopus. \n\n\n\n### Search strategy \n  \nOur search was designed in line with PRISMA\u2010S guideline  and is presented in (Appendix  ). \n\n\n### Selection process \n  \nAV and MM independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified studies for inclusion. Disagreements in this stage were resolved through discussion. Full text of potentially eligible studies was retrieved. Each study was included when both reviewers independently assessed it as satisfying the inclusion criteria from the full text. MF acted as arbiter in the event of disagreement following discussion. \n\n\n### Data collection process \n  \nUsing a standardized form, AV and MM extracted the data independently. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. In cases in which PPMS or CIS patients were also included in a study, we included such studies only if CIS and PPMS patients consisted less than 15% of the study's sample size. \n\n\n### Data items \n  \n#### Outcomes \n  \nThe main outcome of interest was the correlation between the T1\u00a0hypointense lesions\u2019 mean volume on cerebral MRI and the EDSS score of participants. Some studies reported measurements at multiple time points for the same participants. In these cases, we averaged the presented correlation coefficients using the formula presented by Alexander : \n\n\n#### Other variables \n  \nOther variables of interest that we extracted from the included studies were the following:\n   \nsample characteristics \n  \nsample size \n  \nstudy methods \n  \ninclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nMRI settings used \n  \nfounding sources \n  \ndeclarations of interests. \n  \n\n\n\n### Study risk of bias assessment \n  \nAV and MM assessed the risk of bias of each included study. We resolved any disagreements by consensus. \n\nWe used a tailored version of the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool,  presented in (Appendix  ). Our tailored version of the tool consisted of six domains: study participation, study attrition, prognostic factor measurement, outcome measurement, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting. \n\n\n### Summary measures \n  \nThe summary measure used for our review was Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r). \n\n\n### Synthesis methods \n  \nWe used R version 4 \u201cmeta\u201d package  and \u201crob.summary\u201d package  as the software for our data synthesis. \n\n#### Eligibility for synthesis \n  \nAll studies that met our eligibility criteria and reported our outcome of interest were assessed to be eligible for quantitative synthesis. \n\n\n#### Preparing for synthesis \n  \nGiven that our effect measure of interest should have been reported directly in the included studies, no data transformation or conversion was deemed necessary. The only exception was the conversion of Pearson's correlation coefficients to Spearman's, which is described above. Although we did not face any situation to perform this conversion, imputation of missing data was not applicable for our effect measure either. \n\n\n#### Tabulation and graphical methods \n  \nWe planned to present the results of each included study with the 95% confidence interval for the effect measure, in conjunction with the synthesized effect estimate, in a forest plot. \n\n\n#### Statistical synthesis methods \n  \nWe used correlation coefficients (  r  ) as our summary measure. Most meta\u2010analysts do not perform syntheses on the correlation coefficient itself because the variance depends strongly on the correlation. Rather, the correlation is converted to the Fisher's z scale and all analyses are performed using the transformed values. We performed a meta\u2010analysis on converted the Fisher's z scale values based on the random\u2010effects model. Finally, we converted back Fisher's z to r for the sake of presentation. \n\n\n#### Methods to explore heterogeneity \n  \nWe expected some heterogeneity between studies because of methodological diversity. We evaluated the range of the effects of the random\u2010effects meta\u2010analyses using prediction intervals, \u03c7 \u00a0statistics, and   I  \u00a0statistics. \u03c7 \u00a0statistics considered to be interpreted as substantial if either \u03c4  was greater than zero, or there was a   p  \u2010value < 0.10.   I  \u00a0statistic quantifies inconsistency across studies to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the meta\u2010analysis  and is interpreted as:\n   \n0%\u201340%: might not be important; \n  \n30%\u201360%: moderate; \n  \n50%\u201390%: substantial; \n  \n75%\u2013100%: considerable. \n  \n\nTo investigate the possible sources of heterogeneity, we performed subgroup analyses based on classification of MS (RRMS or SPMS), the diagnostic criteria used for the diagnosis (Poser or McDonald), and the static magnetic field (SMF) used for the MRI (\u22651.5T or <1.5T). \n\n\n#### Sensitivity analyses \n  \nWe performed sensitivity analyses on studies with the following factors:\n   \nComponent\u2010based analyses for studies with at least one domain at high or unclear risk of bias \n  \nVery large studies to establish the extent to which they dominate the results. \n  \n\n\n\n### Reporting bias assessment \n  \nTo evaluate the risk of reporting bias across studies, a contour\u2010enhanced funnel plot was generated using Fisher's z transformed correlation for visual inspection of potential publication bias. This plot was designed to have contour lines corresponding to perceived milestones of statistical significance (  p  \u2010value = 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1). A test for funnel plot asymmetry was conducted. \n\n\n### Certainty assessment \n  \nThe strength of the overall body of evidence was assessed using an adapted version of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework for prognostic factor research,  which takes into account five considerations: study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. We considered a moderate/large effect size as a criterion for upgrading the certainty of evidence. AV and MM rated the certainty of the evidence for the outcome as \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201clow,\u201d or \u201cvery low\u201d. We resolved any discrepancies by consensus. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Study selection \n  \n#### Flow of studies \n  \nFor a detailed summary of the results of the search, see the PRISMA flow diagram presented in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nPRISMA Flow diagram of the study \n  \nFor this review, we identified 2069 records in our primary search (65 CENTRAL, 1192 Embase, 254\u00a0MEDLINE through PubMed, and 550\u00a0Web of Science). After removing duplicates, we screened the titles and abstracts of 1206 records. Another 1120 records were excluded at that stage, and 86 records remained for full\u2010text assessment. We excluded 67\u00a0studies after assessing the full text of the records. We also found 8 relevant studies through citation searching (Scopus). In the end, we included 27\u00a0studies ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   for quantitative and qualitative analysis. \n\n\n#### Excluded studies \n  \nWe excluded 59\u00a0studies in the full\u2010text assessment phase. For a full description of the reasons for the exclusion of these 59\u00a0studies, see (Appendix  ). \n\n\n\n### Study characteristics \n  \nWe included 27\u00a0studies with 1919 participants. For a detailed summary of the characteristics of the included studies, see (Appendix  ). \n\n\n### Risk of bias in studies \n  \nFigure\u00a0 \u00a0shows the risk of bias judgments for each domain in all included studies. Judgments for each domain across studies are shown in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nRisk of bias graph: review authors\u2019 judgments about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies \n    \nRisk of bias summary: review authors\u2019 judgments about each risk of bias item for each included study \n  \n#### Study participation \n  \nEight studies were at high risk of bias for this domain, ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   mostly due to inadequate information about the diagnostic criteria used for the diagnosis of MS. The only exception was the study of Giugni et al.  that although did not report the diagnostic criteria used, due to adequate description of participants, we judged that it did not put the study at a higher risk of bias. \n\n\n#### Study attrition \n  \nOnly one study was judged to be at a considerable risk of bias in this domain. Masek et al.  did not provide any information about the patients that were lost to follow\u2010up or the reason for the loss. \n\n\n#### Prognostic factor measurement \n  \nTwo studies were at risk of bias for this domain. Garrido et al.  did not provide any information about the prognostic factor measurement techniques used and thus was at high risk of bias, while Masek et al.  provided little information regarding this matter for the review authors to be able to judge it and thus was at unclear risk of bias. \n\n\n#### Outcome measurement \n  \nFive studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias in this domain ,  ,  ,  ,   because they did not report if the outcome assessors were trained physicians and if the same outcome assessors assessed all the participants. \n\n\n#### Study confounding \n  \nMost of the included studies were at high risk of bias regarding this domain, due to not reporting or inadequate reporting of the potential confounding factors in their studies. Six studies ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   reported potential confounders or the ways used to account for the confounders and thus were judged to be at low risk of bias in this domain. \n\n\n#### Statistical analysis and reporting \n  \nTwenty\u2010six studies reported the appropriate effect size (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient) directly. The only exception was the study of Masek et al.  which did not provide enough statistical information about the participants and we had to impute the effect size based on a presented graph. \n\n\n\n### Results of individual studies \n  \nAll studies reported a positive correlation coefficient, with the only exception being the study of O'Riordan et al.  which reported a negative correlation. In most of the studies, the correlation was also statistically significant. Nine studies concluded that the correlation was not statistically significant. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   For a detailed summary of the results of individual studies, see the forest plot in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nForest plot of the overall synthesis: The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (COR) between cerebral MRI T1\u00a0hypointense lesion load and EDSS score of RRMS and SPMS participants \n  \n\n### Results of syntheses \n  \n#### Characteristics of contributing studies \n  \nA summary of the characteristics of the contributing studies is provided in Table\u00a0 . \n  \nSummary of the characteristics of the contributing studies \n    \n##### Design \n  \nFifteen of the included studies were in cross\u2010sectional design, ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   while eleven were cohorts. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   There was also one trial in our included studies  which we treated like cross\u2010sectional studies for data extraction and bias assessment. \n\n\n##### Sample sizes \n  \nThe median sample size was 41 participants (interquartile range 28.5\u201369.5). The smallest sample size was 11  and the largest sample size was 432. \n\n\n##### Setting \n  \nEleven studies were conducted in the USA, ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   four studies were conducted in Netherlands, ,  ,  ,   three studies were conducted in Italy, ,  ,   three studies were conducted in the United Kingdom, ,  ,   two studies were conducted in Germany, ,   one study was conducted in Spain,  one study was conducted in Czech Republic,  and two studies were conducted in more than one country (one in Italy and Netherlands ; the other in Canada; and multiple sites across Europe ). \n\n\n##### Participants \n  \nAll studies were conducted on adults. Most studies presented a detailed summary report of the age and sex of the participants. Only two studies ,   did not provide such a detailed summary report. \n\n\n##### Diagnostic criteria \n  \nEleven studies used the Poser criteria for the diagnosis of MS. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   Seven studies used one of the variants of the McDonald criteria for this purpose. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   Nine studies did not specify which sets of criteria were used for the sake of diagnosis. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  \n\n\n##### MRI parameters \n  \nStatic magnetic fields, sequences used, and thickness of slices are mentioned here. For a more in\u2010depth evaluation of the MRI parameters of the included studies, see (Appendix  ). \n\n###### Static magnetic field \n  \nThree studies used a static magnetic field (SMF) of 3.0\u00a0Tesla, ,  ,   thirteen studies used an SMF of 1.5\u00a0Tesla, ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   three studies used 1.0\u00a0Tesla, ,  ,   two studies used 0.6\u00a0T, ,   and two studies used 0.5\u00a0T. ,   Two studies did not report their SMF, ,   while two studies used a variety of SMFs. ,  \n\n\n###### Sequence \n  \nMost studies used Conventional Spin Echo (CSE) as the MRI sequence. Four studies used Fast Spin Echo (FSE) sequence. ,  ,  ,   One study used both CSE and FSE.  One study used 3\u2010Dimensional Modified Driven Equilibrium Fourier Transform (3D MDEFT) sequence.  One study used Magnetization Prepared\u2010Rapid Gradient Echo (MP\u2010RAGE).  One multi\u2010centric study used either CSE or MP\u2010RAGE.  Finally, one study did not report the sequence used. \n\n\n###### Slice thickness \n  \nMost studies used a slice thickness of 5mm. One study sets slice thickness to 1.6mm (3D MDEFT sequence).  Slice thickness was 1mm in another study (MP\u2010RAGE sequence).  Six studies used a slice thickness of 3mm. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   Finally, three studies did not report this parameter. ,  ,  \n\n\n\n\n#### Results of statistical syntheses \n  \nTwenty\u2010seven studies obtained data sufficient for quantitative synthesis. Results of the meta\u2010analysis are presented in Figure\u00a0 . \n\nA positive r corresponds to a higher EDSS score in participants with larger lesion loads and vice versa. \n\nThe pooled sample size was 1919. The pooled estimated Spearman's r was 0.32, with a 95% CI of 0.26\u20130.37 and a   p  \u2010value of <0.0001. Thus, we conclude that there is a significant positive correlation between the T1\u00a0lesion load and EDSS score. As a rule of thumb, this r is judged to represent a weak to slightly moderate correlation. \n\n\n#### Results of investigations of heterogeneity \n  \nThe study of O\u2019Riordan et al.  appeared to be an outlier, which can be a reason for statistical heterogeneity. The prediction intervals for the summary effect were 0.11\u20130.50. \u03c4  was 0.0102 with a   p  \u2010value < 0.01.   I   was 43% which is considered as a moderate size of heterogeneity. \n\nFor subgroup analysis based on the MS, we had 8\u00a0studies ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   in the RRMS subgroup and 6\u00a0studies in the SPMS subgroup. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   This synthesis indicated there was no clear difference between groups (test for subgroup differences: \u03c7  = 0.58, df = 1,   p   = 0.44). \n\nFor subgroup analysis based on the diagnostic criteria used for the diagnosis, we had 7\u00a0studies ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   in McDonald subgroup 11\u00a0studies in the Poser subgroup. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   Again, there was no difference between the groups (test for subgroup differences: \u03c7  = 0.14, df = 1,   p   = 0.70). \n\nFor subgroup analysis based on the SMF used for MRI, only 7\u00a0studies had an SMF less than 1.5T. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   Statistical synthesis revealed there was no difference between the groups (test for subgroup differences: \u03c7  = 0.29, df =1,   p   = 0.59). \n\nThe forest plots for the subgroup analyses are presented in (Appendix  ). \n\n\n#### Results of sensitivity analyses \n  \nFor sensitivity analysis on studies with a large sample size (<90), there were 5\u00a0studies. ,  ,  ,  ,   The results of this synthesis were not much different from our overall results (  n   = 1026,   r   = 0.29, 95% CI 0.22\u20130.36). \n\nWe also performed component\u2010based analysis on the bias domains. Eight studies were at risk of bias for the participation domain. ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   The results of synthesis on these studies indicated the direction of r was not different in these studies (  n   = 256,   r   = 0.24, 95% CI 0.05\u20130.41). \n\nFive studies were at risk of bias in the outcome measurement domain. ,  ,  ,  ,   The results of synthesis on these studies indicated the direction of r was not different in these studies (  n   = 261,   r   = 0.29, 95% CI 0.17\u20130.40). \n\nTwenty\u2010one studies were at risk of bias in the study confounding domain. The results of synthesis on these studies indicated the direction of r was not different in these studies (  n   = 954,   r   = 0.33, 95% CI 0.25\u20130.41). \n\nThe forest plots for all sensitivity analyses are presented in (Appendix  ). These analyses underline the robustness of the results. \n\n\n\n### Reporting biases \n  \nThe contour\u2010enhanced funnel plot is presented in Figure\u00a0 . \n  \nContour\u2010enhanced funnel plot \n  \nVisual inspection confirmed that the plot was symmetrical, indicating a low risk for publication bias. Also, a Rank correlation test for funnel plot asymmetry  was performed which yielded non\u2010significant results (  p   = 0.83), confirming there is no significant risk of publication bias in our review. \n\n\n### Certainty of evidence \n  \n#### Study limitations \n  \nTwenty\u2010two studies were at risk of bias for at least one domain. Five studies were at risk of bias for two domains. Three studies were at risk of bias in three domains. One study was at risk of bias in all six domains. The most common sources of potential bias in these studies were as follows: not appropriately accounting for potential confounders in the design and the analysis, not presenting sufficient data to assess the validity of the diagnosis of participants, and not presenting enough data for validating the outcome measurement methods used. Moreover, we sometimes observed no description of inclusion/exclusion criteria. In general, we considered the included studies to have some serious study limitations. Thus, we decided to downgrade the certainty of evidence by one level. \n\n\n#### Inconsistency \n  \nThe   I   was 43% while \u03c4  was 0.0102 with a   p   of less than 0.01. These results indicated moderate inconsistencies in our included studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses revealed no difference in the direction of effect in various subsets of studies. Therefore, we decided not to downgrade the certainty of evidence of the results because of this domain. \n\n\n#### Indirectness \n  \n##### Indirectness in population \n  \nIn this review, we were interested in adult patients with a diagnosis of either RRMS or SPMS. All of our included studies evaluated this population, and we did not encounter any serious indirectness in this domain. \n\n\n##### Indirectness in prognostic factor \n  \nOur prognostic factor of interest was the cerebral MRI T1\u00a0hypointense lesions volume. Considering the specificity of our prognostic factor, there is no indirect way of measuring it. Thus, there are no considerable issues in this domain. \n\n\n##### Indirectness in outcome \n  \nThe outcome of interest for our study was the disability measure using EDSS. All included studies used this scale, and thus, there was no issue in this domain either. \n\n\n\n#### Imprecision \n  \nThe pooled sample size for our review was 1919 which is considered an adequate sample size. 95% CI for the pooled effect size in our meta\u2010analysis was 0.26\u20130.37, which represents a weak to slightly moderate correlation. Also, it is worth mentioning that the pooled 95% CI did not overlap the value of no effect. In conclusion, there was no reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence regarding this domain. \n\n\n#### Publication bias \n  \nWe evaluated the risk of the publication bias using a contour\u2010enhanced funnel plot, observational assessment of the funnel plot for asymmetry, and statistical test of the symmetry of the funnel plot. All of our investigations indicated that there was a low risk for publication bias, so we decided not to downgrade the quality of this evidence for publication bias. \n\n\n#### Moderate/large effect size \n  \nOur synthesis reported a weak to slightly moderate effect size for the correlation between MRI T1\u00a0hypointense lesion load and EDSS score. So, we decided not to upgrade the quality of evidence for the moderate/large effect size domain. \n\n\n#### Overall assessment of the confidence in cumulative evidence \n  \nWe represent the results of the assessments of each domain evaluated for the confidence in cumulative evidence, with overall confidence in cumulative evidence level in Table\u00a0 . \n  \nConfidence in cumulative evidence \n    \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \n### Interpretation \n  \nA variety of quantitative measures derived from conventional and advanced MRI methods have been suggested as prognostic biomarkers for MS. However, as the correlations between different MRI indicators and EDSS have been variable,  no single MRI\u2010derived measure has been used as a comprehensive prognostic imaging biomarker for MS.  Due to the lack of T2\u2010hyperintense lesions specificity, attention has been drawn to T1\u00a0hypointense lesions, which represent areas of chronic axonal destruction that is more closely linked to current impairment.  Unfortunately, this marker has infrequently been considered, resulting in insufficient evidence on the prognostic impact of this MRI marker. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta\u2010analysis that evaluates the value of T1\u00a0hypointense lesions\u2019 mean volume as a prognostic factor of disability levels in patients with RRMS or SPMS. Our meta\u2010analysis of 27\u00a0studies showed a weak to a slightly moderate positive correlation between the prognostic factor and the outcome. Subgroup analyses revealed the effect is no different for RRMS or SPMS patients. They also revealed that the diagnostic criteria used for the diagnosis of MS do not affect the magnitude or direction of the correlation. Also, we found that the SMF of the MRI devices used did not result in considerable heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses revealed that studies with a large sample size or studies at risk of bias in the evaluated domains did not affect the magnitude or direction of the correlation. These analyses underline the robustness of the results. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be high. \n\nMaking composites based on a combination of MRI measurements has been suggested in the literature as a promising way to assess the disease's clinical course.  In a study by Poonawalla et al.,  a variety of composites were tested and the Z3d composition was found to be the most powerful:   Z   (Ratio of CSF volume to total intracranial volume) +   Z   (\u201cBlack hole\u201d: T1\u00a0hypointense lesion volume) +   Z   (Mean T2\u00a0value of T1\u2010lesions). Although it is necessary to mention that each of these measurements necessitates additional imaging sequences, so their practicality remains an area of discussion. Also, since the z\u2010score varies from person to person, its correlation with EDSS may not be clinically interpretable or practical. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that even though EDSS is commonly used to assess clinical impairment in MS, there is widespread consensus that it lacks sensitivity, and National MS Society Clinical Outcomes Assessment Task Force adopted the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) score as an alternative to EDSS.  Future studies can evaluate the correlation between MSFC and MRI measures to obtain more sensitive results. \n\n\n### Limitations of evidence \n  \nA large proportion of the included studies were found to be at risk of bias in at least one domain. This factor lowers the certainty of the evidence. Besides that, there were no other serious limitations in our review. \n\n\n### Limitations of review processes \n  \nWe encountered a considerable number of studies that probably evaluated the prognostic factor and outcome related to our review, but unfortunately, did not report the results. We tried to reach the authors for the data, but were not successful or were not provided with the data. Including those studies could have a substantial effect on our results. Also, a large proportion of the included studies did not mention or account for the potential confounding factors which resulted in downgrading the confidence in our results. \n\n\n### Implications \n  \nOur results indicate that the cerebral MRI T1\u00a0hypointense lesions load is a weak to moderate prognostic factor in practice to estimate the disability rate of RRMS and SPMS patients. Future studies should evaluate other imaging markers\u2019 validity for this purpose, such as cerebral MRI T2\u00a0lesions load or T1 to T2 ratio. \n\n\n\n## PROTOCOL \n  \nThe protocol is published elsewhere. \n\n\n## AMENDMENTS \n  \nAs a post hoc decision, we decided to assess the heterogeneity of the included studies by also using   I   and \u03c4 . We also encountered some studies that reported our outcome of interest at several time points for the same participants. So as another post hoc decision, we decided to average the results of different time points using the formula provided in the methods section. We also found out a large proportion of the studies which reported our prognostic factor and outcome of desire, used the Poser criteria instead of the McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of patients. Thus, we decided to add the Poser criteria as another acceptable method in the population section of our eligibility criteria. We also performed subgroup analyses based on the diagnostic criteria used in the primary studies (Poser or McDonald) and based on the SMF of the MRI in the primary studies (\u22651.5T or <1.5T). The rest of the review was done according to our published protocol's methods. \n\n\n## CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS \n  \nNone declared. \n\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n  \nAV involved in coordination of the review, designing review, designing the protocol, performing the search, study selection, data extraction, assessing the risk of bias in included studies, analysis of data, interpretation of the results, assessing the confidence in cumulative evidence, and writing the review.

Seed-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in subjects at increased risk of developing psychosis have begun to identify abnormalities in rsFC, although reported findings remain mixed. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of seed-based resting-state fMRI studies to test whether high-risk subjects show rsFC alterations relative to healthy controls within and between the default mode network (DMN), control executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nA literature search was performed to identify seed-based resting-state fMRI studies comparing subjects with genetic risk factors, psychotic-like experiences, and clinical high-risk for psychosis to healthy controls. Then, coordinates of seed regions were extracted and categorized into networks by their location within a priori templates. Activation likelihood estimate (ALE) analysis examined the reported coordinates for hypo-connectivity and hyper-connectivity with each a priori network. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe meta-analysis included 15 studies (774 subjects at risk, 628 healthy controls) on clinical high-risk for psychosis, 6 studies (123 subjects at risk, 147 healthy controls) on psychotic-like experiences, and 5 studies (173 subjects at risk, 256 healthy controls) on genetic risk factors of developing psychosis. We found specific patterns of hypo- and hyper-connectivity within and between large-scale networks. Our results showed that subjects with high-risk for psychosis were characterized by hypo-connectivity within the SN and CEN and hyper-connectivity within the DMN and CEN. Network seeds in the DMN, CEN, and SN displayed hyper-connectivity with regions in other networks. The DMN seeds displayed hypo-connectivity with regions in the CEN, while CEN and SN seeds displayed hypo-connectivity with regions in the DMN. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis provides evidence that subjects at risk for psychosis present distinctive abnormalities of hyper- and hypo-connectivity within and between the DMN, CEN and SN, particularly implicating network dys-connectivity as a core deficit underlying the psychopathology of psychosis in the preclinical phase. More studies are needed to investigate whether subjects at risk to develop psychosis present patterns of dysfunction between the rsFC of healthy subjects and that of patients with established psychosis. \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7234455, "text_md5": "a42e0e5302fd04d67dea26ad44a1567c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 129], "journal": [130, 144], "publication_year": [146, 150], "title": [161, 318], "keywords": [332, 332], "abstract": [345, 2963], "body": [2972, 2972]}, "batch": 2, "doi": "10.1093/schbul/sbaa029.716", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7234455", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7234455"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7234455\">7234455</a>", "list_title": "PMC7234455  T156.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the key prognostic tool for MS, primarily at the early stage of the disease. Recent findings showed that white matter lesion (WML) counts and volumes could predict long-term disability for MS. However, the prognostic value of MRI in the early stage of the disease and its link to long-term physical disability have not been assessed systematically and quantitatively. A meta-analysis was conducted using studies from four databases to assess whether MS lesion counts and volumes at baseline MRI scans could predict long-term disability, assessed by the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Fifteen studies were eligible for the qualitative analysis and three studies for meta-analysis. T2 brain lesion counts and volumes after the disease onset were associated with disability progression after 10 years. Four or more lesions at baseline showed a highly significant association with EDSS 3 and EDSS 6, with a pooled OR of 4.10 and 4.3, respectively. The risk increased when more than 10 lesions were present. This review and meta-analysis confirmed that lesion counts and volumes could be associated with disability and might offer additional valid guidance in treatment decision making. Future work is essential to determine whether these prognostic markers have high predictive potential. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has an essential role in multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and prognosis, for estimating the risk of developing MS [ ] and assessing MS disease activity when making treatment decisions [ , , ]. The neurological disability varies among patients, from practically asymptomatic patients [ , ] to those with severe neurological disability and shortened life. Recently, early treatment initiation has gained an interest for preventing/eliminating long-term disability and induce remission. However, disease-modifying therapy (DMT) might be associated with life-changing side effects [ , ]. \n\nThe first presentation of MS is referred to as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Patients present with an episode of neurological symptoms that at least partially resolves [ ]. However, up to 85% of CIS patients develop relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) [ ]. Following a CIS, a higher initial brain white matter lesion (WML) load and volume over the first 5 years were thought to be associated with the increasing risk of developing the disability and conversion MS subtype in 20 years [ , ]. Given this, assessing the association between WML lesion load and volume on an MRI scan obtained at the initial presentation (CIS) and their prediction of long-term disability is crucial [ ]. \n\nDifferent reviews have been performed on MRI factors and their association with the risk of developing MS [ , ]; however, most do not fulfil the systematic review criteria [ , , ]. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review with a meta-analysis assessing the prognostic value of MRI in MS and predicting long-term physical disability. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \n### 2.1. Study Registration \n  \nThis systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (updated PRISMA) guidelines [ ] and were registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) database (CRD42021249236) in May 2021. \n\n\n### 2.2. Sources, Search Strategy, and Screening \n  \nFour electronic databases were searched (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed) with the keywords (\u201cMagnetic Resonance Imaging\u201d or \u201cMRI\u201d), (\u201cLesion\u201d or \u201clesions\u201d), (\u201cCount or Counts\u201d), and (\u201cMultiple Sclerosis\u201d or \u201cMS\u201d). For the Medline search strategy, see  . Mendeley was used for bibliographic management, including duplicate removal. \n\nThe search strategy was conducted by three reviewers A.I.A. (Amjad I. AlTokhis), A.A. (Abrar AlAmrani), and A.A. (Abdulmajeed AlOtaibi), who also verified the database selections, study screening/identification, study eligibility/inclusion, and quality assessments independently and blindly. \n\n\n### 2.3. Study Selection (Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria) \n  \nStudies were considered for inclusion if they: (i) were longitudinal prospective and retrospective studies; (ii) reported the association between baseline MRI lesion count or volume and MS disability; (iii) included \u2265 10 years of follow-ups to assess disease progression, as disability is usually a slow process from the disease onset, and the predictive value of the short-term disability evolution within the first years is low [ ]; (iv) investigated the association between white matter lesions count/volume in MS and disability, with at least one of the MRI measurements (T1/T2 lesion number or count) at the baseline; (v) reported EDSS as an outcome; (vi) were published in peer-reviewed journals; (vii) were written in English; and (viii) included all MS subtypes, but only findings related to early relapse onset (CIS) were included. \n\nStudies were considered for exclusion if: (i) they were placebo arms of randomised controlled MS immunotherapy treatment studies, because the placebo arms often convert to treatment after 2 years; (ii) the participants were under 18 years old; (iii) they reported on different MRI techniques (e.g., spectroscopy), or only reported on prognostic models; and/or (iv) they were reviews, opinion pieces, editorials, comments, no-full text articles, technical, or animal studies. A manual search of the reference lists of the included studies was performed to detect further eligible studies. \n\n\n### 2.4. Data Extraction \n  \nIn April 2021, full texts were examined independently by three reviewers (A.I.A., A.A., and A.A) according to the predefined inclusion criteria. Disagreement over including or excluding a study was resolved by discussion. \n\nThe same reviewers independently extracted demographics, disease-specific data, and outcome data (including age, gender, disease duration, EDSS score, population groups, and sample size), and then the results were compared. All included studies assessing disability, MS, or SPMS in relation to baseline MRI data were extracted. \n\n\n### 2.5. Outcome Measures \n  \nThe primary outcome was assessing disability using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Thus, studies that evaluated the mean EDSS and time to reach EDSS 3 or 6 were included. \n\n\n### 2.6. Quality Assessment \n  \nTo assess the validity of the included studies, the quality in prognosis studies (QIPS) tool [ ] was used. It contains six domains to appraise the following: (i) participation; (ii) attrition; (iii) prognostic factor measurement (MRI in this study); (iv) outcome measurement; (v) study confounding; and (vi) analysis. A judgment concerning the related risk of bias was assigned for each domain (yes, partly, no), and a checklist was used to assess the quality and completeness of MRI reporting. Citation chaining from reviews and other papers discovered by reviewers was carried out, and the searches were re-run before the final analysis in June 2021. Disagreement between reviewers was solved by mutual discussion. \n\n\n### 2.7. Statistical Analysis \n  \nStudy characteristics and extracted variables were summarised using standard descriptive statistics. Continuous variables were expressed as means and SD, and categorical variables were expressed as frequencies or percentages. The meta-analysis of binary outcomes was expressed as OR with 95% CI. A random-effects model and the Mantel\u2013Haenszel method were used to pool the study the odd ratios and compute an overall   p  -value. Heterogeneity tests were conducted as a chi-square variate (with the assumption of the homogeneity of effect sizes). The I  statistic was used to assess the extent of between-study heterogeneity. Study heterogeneity I  values > 50% were considered to be substantial and those >75% were deemed to have considerable heterogeneity. All   p  -values were two-tailed, with values < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Review Manager 5.4.1 software (Cochrane organisation, London, UK) implemented all analyses. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Literature Search and Study Characteristics \n  \nThe systematic search retrieved 1108 studies. A total of 423 studies remained after removing duplicate studies and ineligible studies, such as case studies and letters, using an automated tool with each database. Screening the title and abstract excluded 399 studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria. A total of 25 studies remained for full-text assessment. Of those, 15 studies [ , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ] fulfilled the eligibility criteria for qualitative synthesis, while three studies [ , , , , , ] were included in the meta-analysis ( ). \n\n\n### 3.2. Cohort Description \n  \nLondon (The National Hospital, Queen Square; Moorfields Eye Hospital) has two different cohorts, namely London 1 in 1984\u20131987 and London 2 in 1995\u20132004 [ , , , ]. The London 1 cohort [ , ] included 140 patients scanned at baseline [ ] and followed clinically after 5 [ ], 10 [ ], 14 [ ], and 20 years [ ] by assessing the EDSS changes throughout the years. \n\nFilippi [ ] performed a reanalysis of the 5-years cohort data [ ]. Similarly, Sailer [ ] and colleagues used the data of 58 patients from the 5- and 10-year London 1 cohort. Filippi and Sailer used semi-automated MRI analysis techniques, and Chung et al. (2020) used the same data after 30 years of follow-ups [ ]. In London 2, the cohort was part of a follow-up study of 143 patients and the EDSS was assessed at 5 years. \n\nBarcelona (Vall d\u2019Heborn University Hospital) has a centre-based cohort that started in 1995 and is ongoing [ , , ]. CIS patients are included consecutively with an assessment of the EDSS and relapses every 3\u20136 months [ , , ] or annually [ ]. MRI scans were performed at baseline (3\u20135 months after CIS diagnosis), 12 months after, and then every 5 years [ ]. The EDSS was assessed at each visit [ , , ]. Several studies were published from this cohort, including the first [ ], which was a 7-year longitudinal study of 175 patients. In contrast, the study in 2010 focused on the prognostic role of infratentorial lesions at baseline by retrospectively analysing 77 patients with infratentorial lesions out of 246 patients [ ]. Another study in 2015 included 1058 patients [ ]. A publication [ ] in 2019 reported on 401 patients. The cohorts of the included studies used the Poser and McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis. \n\n\n### 3.3. Quality Assessment \n  \nThere was high heterogeneity between studies due to several causes, namely, different study designs (centre or multi-centre-based cohort), prospective and retrospective studies, and the broad spectrum of study duration starting from 1984 to ongoing studies ( ). \n\nThere was no systematic way to report findings, making finding and comparing the results challenging. A striking observation was made of the way the results were reported between the studies; mainly, the raw data related to the primary outcome were not reported and cannot be accessed. For example, the lesion counts and volumes at baseline and follow-up were not reported, making it challenging to compare. Additionally, different findings that were not essential to the primary outcome were reported instead of illustrating that no significant results were found. \n\nMultiple studies were published, but they were using the same cohort [ , , , , , , , ], while other centres did not report the needed information. The Italy cohort [ ] were not included in the meta-analysis, as all members of the study cohort reached EDSS 6. \n\nQuality assessment for potential bias showed mixed results. Specifically, quality was not consistent for \u201cprognostic factor\u201d (MRI measurements), \u201coutcome measurement (i.e., EDSS), and \u201cconfounding measurement and account\u201d (immunotherapy). Detailed information about essential and raw data was often missing, including lesion count/volume at baseline and their association with EDSS 3 or EDSS 6. \n\nAdditionally, variability in MRI sequences, field strengths, and rater-blinding strategies led to more heterogeneity between studies. The MRI data synthesis showed that most of the studies provided information on field strength and scan resolution. However, clinical data blinding was only reported in eight studies, and the number of raters was reported in 11 studies. The most common sequence used in lesion detection was T2-weighted images using a semi-automated tool. Complete information can be found in  .\n   \nQuality assessment and potential bias: No:  , Partly:  , Yes:  . \n  \n\n\n### 3.4. Study Results \n  \nAt baseline, the patients\u2019 mean age ranged from 29 to 32 years, and 67% were female across all cohorts. However, no data were given regarding the mortality rate after the onset and its correlation with MRI parameters/findings. To predict disability after CIS, we compared different MRI prognostic features, namely, lesion counts and volumes. Additionally, we assessed how these MRI features could also predict the conversion to MS. Limited information about the SPMS transition was reported. Besides disability\u2014which was the main endpoint of this review\u2014the conversion of MS and different prognostic factors were also looked at.   shows a summary of the included studies, detailing characteristics of the included studies (qualitative and quantitative). \n\n#### 3.4.1. Baseline MRI Lesions \n    \nTen to fourteen years \n  \nThe London 1 cohort showed a moderate correlation between the number of T2 lesions at baseline and EDSS after a mean of 10 and 14 years of follow-ups (  r   = 0.54,   p   < 0.001) [ ] (  r   = 0.47,   p   < 0.001) [ ], respectively. In the 14-years follow-up cohort, three time points (5, 10, and 14 years) were studied for both lesion counts and volumes. They followed four MS patients with a normal MRI scan and a median EDSS of 1.75, and 44 MS patients with an abnormal MRI and a median EDSS of 3.5. Additionally, a moderate correlation of newly formed lesions was also reported (  r   = 0.59,   p   < 0.001). With lesion volume, there was a moderate correlation in lesion volumes at 10 years (  r   = 0.48,   p   < 0.001), while a weak correlation was found in the change in lesion volume over 10\u201314 years of follow-ups (  r   = 0.35,   p   < 0.02) [ ]. Baseline lesion counts and volumes seem to be larger and increase over time in patients with worse clinical outcomes [ ]. \n  \nFifteen to twenty years \n  \nIn Fisniku, London 1, T2 lesion volume (baseline, 5, 10, 14, and 20 years) correlated moderately after 20 years of follow-ups (  r   = \u20130.48 to 0.67,   p   < 0.001). The change in T2 lesion volume over 10\u201314 years (  r   = 0.40,   p   < 0.004) and over 14\u201320 years (  r   = 0.49,   p   < 0.001) correlated weakly to moderately with the change in EDSS after 20 years [ ]. Only one study reported brain atrophy and gadolinium-enhancing lesions as MRI measurements rather than lesion counts and volumes [ ]. \n\n\n#### 3.4.2. MS Progression \n  \nTo capture disease conversion, this was only reported in the London cohort [ , , , ]. Fisniku reported that 28 (42%) patients with MS converted to SPMS 20 years later [ ]. There was a significant trend for the development of SPMS to be associated with a higher T2 lesion volume increase over 20 years than in patients who remained RRMS (  p   = 0.007), and the T2 lesion volume increase in patients diagnosed with SPMS appeared to be higher than in those with RRMS (  p   = 0.08) [ ]. Results on MRI and mortality were not reported. \n\n\n\n### 3.5. Meta-Analysis Results \n  \n#### 3.5.1. Lesions Count and Disability in MS Patients \n  \nTwo centres reported on the same cohorts but with different follow-ups, namely, the London cohort [ , , , , , ] and the Barcelona cohort [ , ]. Thus, for forest plots, we included the study that reported the needed data: London [ ], Barcelona [ ], and Norway [ ]. Renard\u2019s [ ] cohort was also excluded from the quantitative analysis, as all their patients reached EDSS 6. Three studies reported on WML count and EDSS 3 and showed a significant association between the increased WML and higher odds of EDSS 3 ( A). After pooling, four or more lesions at baseline showed a highly significant association with EDSS 3 (  p   < 0.001), with a pooled OR of 4.10 (95% CI 2.73\u20136.18). The detection of ten or more lesions had even a higher pooled OR of 4.15 (95% CI 2.89\u20135.95) and was highly significant (  p   < 0.001) ( B). The heterogeneity was very low for both analyses. A diagram illustrates the key elements of the forest plot in  . \n\nThree studies reported on WML count and EDSS 6, and all three showed a significant association between the higher number of WML and higher odds of EDSS 6 ( A). After pooling, four or more lesions at baseline showed a highly significant association with EDSS 6 (  p   < 0.001), with a pooled OR of 4.3 (95% CI 1.094\u201316.89). The detection of ten or more lesions also showed a high significant association with EDSS 6 (  p   < 0.001), and the pooled OR was 5.54 (95% CI 1.61\u201319.06) ( B). The heterogeneity between studies was moderate to fair (I  = 53%, I  = 47% respectively). \n\n\n#### 3.5.2. Lesion Volume and Disability in MS Patients \n  \nThree studies reported on WML volume and disability; however, due to missing raw data, it was impossible to generate forest plots. Thus, descriptive analysis was performed. In the Sailer et al. study, they found a significant correlation at baseline between WML volume and disability (  r =   0.81,   p   < 0.001), but the change in lesion volume during the first 5 years did not show any association with long-term disability [ ]. In contrast, Brex and colleagues found that in CIS patients during the first 5 years, increases in the lesion volume correlated with the degree of long-term disability [ ]. This relationship was moderate, so they concluded that the volume of the lesions alone may not be an adequate basis for decisions about the use of DMT. Lastly, in Italy\u2019s cohort, EDSS worsening over 10 years was best correlated with the combination of baseline lesion count and an increasing lesion volume (R = 0.61,   p   < 0.001) [ ]. \n\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that assesses the prognostic value of MRI for disability with MS. The results illustrate that few studies assessed the prognostic MRI value beyond 10 years in MS patients. Previous work presented some evidence that baseline lesions are associated with EDSS after 10 years [ ]. The larger cohort from Barcelona, which was followed up with after a median of 6.8 years, showed that the risk of an increase in EDSS was higher in patients with 10 or more lesions [ ]. The London cohort reported that T2 lesion volume correlated moderately with EDSS after 20 years [ ]. Similarly, 14 years of follow-ups showed a correlation between EDSS and lesion count at baseline [ ]. \n\nThese findings are in line with our analysis, which showed that both EDSS 3 and EDSS 6 showed a strong positive association with the accumulation of WML at baseline. Therefore, it can be concluded that lesion number and volume could be predictors for long-term disability with MS. Contrarily, a study with 15 years of follow-ups showed no association between baseline MRI lesion count/volume and long-term physical disability [ ]; still, the conversion to another MS subtype was strongly correlated with the baseline MRI. \n\nA longitudinal observational study with a longer follow-up period is needed to capture disease conversion, which was only reported in the London cohort [ , , , ]. \n\nData were derived from only three different cohorts in Barcelona, London, and Norway. A quantitative assessment of these data shows a consistent relationship between early brain lesion loads and subsequent disability. All cohorts were restricted to one city, a fact that might bias the findings and not allow generalization to the other centres. \n\nLesion segmentation and analysis is a vulnerable process, as it depends potentially on the raters\u2019 experience, the software used, the criteria of lesion selection, and image quality. Thus, having a harmonised and standard procedure for lesion segmentation, such as a state-of-the-art automatic segmentation tool (e.g., HyperMapper) [ ], could be beneficial for future studies. \n\nIn terms of age and sex, young females were more likely to have more WML in an early stage of the disease, as our data have shown that around 70% of the study population were females in their 30s. These results are to be expected, as the peak age of onset is around 30 years [ ], and the disease is two to three times more common in females than in males [ ] \n\nTwo studies reported that spinal cord lesions (\u22651 lesion) could predict disability in patients converting to MS [ , ]. However, recent findings highlighted the uncertainty of the prognostic and diagnostic value of spinal cord lesions [ ]. Further work is needed to clarify the independent and interaction impact of brain and upper cervical cord atrophy as promising prognostic markers [ ]. \n\nAlthough higher brain lesion load could be linked with long-term disability, the correlation between early lesion loads and later disability still only explains a small proportion of disabilities. It is also difficult in clinical practice to utilise a certain threshold of disability, and similarly with disease progression milestones. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nThere were several limitations to the data that we could access for our review. Relatively few of the included studies were conducted prospectively, such that the others were potentially vulnerable to various biases due to their retrospective design. In addition, the primary study aims varied considerably, and this could contribute to differences in the observed lesion counts and volumes. Treatment information was not available in the publications. Therefore, a potential differential treatment effect on the disability outcome could not be assessed. Few studies were included in the meta-analysis, and this could cause a publication bias whereby only positive findings were published. Additionally, measuring and defining disability is subjective, and EDSS is prone to human error. Lastly, it should be emphasised that subgroup and meta-analysis are by their nature observational, and results must therefore be interpreted with caution. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nThis systematic review and meta-analysis have confirmed that the number or the volume of WML detected with MRI has the potential to be a prognostic imaging marker for long-term disability. Nevertheless, there is considerable heterogeneity in their assessment, detection, and reporting across studies. While the meta-analysis presented here highlights their potential for playing a prognostic role in MS, patient and lesion levels may limit sensitivity for initial diagnosis. We believe that there is a need to establish clear criteria for evaluating and reporting WML, which would improve the interpretation and comparison of data acquired across studies. Such criteria would thus allow validation and the potential translation of this imaging marker into future clinical practice. Further work with longer clinical follow-ups is required to determine whether lesion count, volume, and regional brain atrophy can be used as predictive imaging biomarkers in MS. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8871297, "text_md5": "9bfa8e2bce5495997c203d21d29c4c92", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 111], "journal": [112, 131], "publication_year": [133, 137], "title": [148, 302], "keywords": [316, 393], "abstract": [406, 1844], "body": [1853, 23889]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35204361, "doi": "10.3390/diagnostics12020270", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8871297", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8871297"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8871297\">8871297</a>", "list_title": "PMC8871297  Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Prognostic Disability Marker in Clinically Isolated Syndrome and Multiple Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"}

Positron emission tomography and radioligands binding to the translocator protein (TSPO), which is expressed in glial cells in the brain including immune cells, represents a potential method for patient stratification and treatment monitoring. This study examined whether patients with first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia had altered TSPO levels compared with healthy control subjects. \n\n\n## METHODS: \n  \nPubMed was searched for studies comparing patients with psychosis with healthy control subjects using second-generation TSPO radioligands. The outcome measure was total distribution volume (V ), an index of TSPO levels, in frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus. Bayes factors (BFs) were applied to examine the relative support for higher, lower, or no difference in patients\u2019 TSPO levels compared with healthy control subjects. \n\n\n## RESULTS: \n  \nFive studies, with 75 participants with first-episode psychosis or schizophrenia and 77 healthy control subjects, were included. BFs showed strong support for lower V  in patients relative to no difference (all BFs > 32), or relative to higher V  (all BFs > 422), in all brain regions. From the posterior distributions, mean patient\u2013control differences in standardized V  values were \u22120.48 for frontal cortex (95% credible interval [CredInt] = \u22120.88 to 0.09), \u22120.47 for temporal cortex (CredInt = \u22120.87 to \u22120.07), and \u22120.63 for hippocampus (CredInt = \u22121.00 to \u22120.25). \n\n\n## CONCLUSIONS: \n  \nThe lower levels of TSPO observed in patients may correspond to altered function or lower density of brain immune cells. Future studies should focus on investigating the underlying biological mechanisms and their relevance for treatment. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nGenetic, epidemiological, and biomolecular data suggest that the immune system is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia ( \u2013 ). When translating these findings into clinical trials, initial studies have shown a positive effect of medication targeting the immune system when used as an add-on treatment to antipsychotics ( \u2013 ). To aid further development of this therapeutic approach, tools for directly assessing the status of the brain immune system are needed to allow for patient stratification and monitoring of treatment effects. \n\nUsing positron emission tomography (PET), the localization and activation state of central nervous system immune response modulators can be assessed with radioligands targeting the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), which is expressed in glial cells ( \u2013 ). During the last decade, a handful of TSPO PET studies have been performed in patients with early-stage psychosis or manifest schizophrenia, showing inconclusive results. Early reports using the first-generation TSPO radioligand (  R  )-[ C]PK11195 showed higher binding in small patient groups (  n   = 7 and   n   = 10) ( , ), albeit with outcome measures that show low accuracy and reliability (i.e., binding potential estimated from rate constants) ( \u2013 ). More recent studies in larger samples using the same radioligand, but without blood sampling for full quantification, did not replicate these findings ( \u2013 ). Concerns regarding the low signal-to-noise ratio of (  R  )-[  C]PK11195 sparked the development of a series of second-generation TSPO radioligands, showing much greater specific binding ( \u2013 ). These tools have subsequently been used to revisit the question of higher levels of TSPO in psychosis ( \u2013 ). When employing gold standard outcome measures of binding in the absence of a reference region (total distribution volume [V ] obtained using kinetic modeling with metabolite-corrected arterial plasma as input function), higher TSPO expression has so far not been found in patients. In some cases, trend-level ( ) or significantly lower ( ) TSPO levels were shown. \n\nAll previous TSPO PET studies in psychosis have been performed with relatively small sample sizes. In addition, TSPO radioligands display substantial within- and between-subject variability ( , ) even after accounting for the TSPO rs6971 polymorphism that is known to affect radioligand binding in vivo ( \u2013 ). This has important implications for sensitivity and the power to detect differences between patients with psychosis and control subjects. Indeed, the power to detect an expected significant medium-sized difference between diagnostic groups (at alpha = .05) has ranged from 23% to 34% in previous designs ( \u2013 ). Medication status has also differed both between and within these studies. Because antipsychotics have been shown to dampen the immune response, this further limits the conclusions that can be drawn ( ). Here, we sought to overcome these limitations and clarify the use of TSPO PET as a biomarker of immune dysfunction in schizophrenia. We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of all TSPO PET studies performed in psychosis or schizophrenia using second-generation radioligands, where V  was included as the outcome measure. The primary objective was to evaluate the hypotheses of 1) higher, 2) lower, or 3) no difference in V  between patients and healthy control subjects (HCs). A secondary objective was to assess the effects of antipsychotic medication on TSPO levels. \n\n## METHODS AND MATERIALS \n  \n### Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses, Preregistration, and Code Availability \n  \nThis meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of IPD (PRISMA-IPD) ( ) and according to a study-specific preregistration protocol. The preregistration protocol and all codes used in this study can be found on the public repository ( ). \n\n\n### Selection Criteria and Search Strategy \n  \nWe set out to obtain IPD from all PET studies that 1) used a second-generation TSPO radioligand, 2) reported V  values in the central nervous system in subjects with psychosis or schizophrenia as compared with HCs, and 3) reported TSPO affinity type of all participants. To our knowledge, there are currently five published studies reporting such data, using the radioligands [ C]PBR28, [ F]FEPPA, and [ C]DPA713 ( \u2013 ). To ascertain that no relevant studies were omitted from this meta-analysis, we performed a systematic literature search on PubMed. Only articles published after 2004 were included in the search, corresponding to the year when the first report on a second-generation TSPO radioligand was published ( ). Search terms included (among others) \u201cpsychotic disorder,\u201d \u201cschizophrenia,\u201d \u201cpositron emission tomography,\u201d \u201ctranslocator protein 18 kDa,\u201d and \u201cperipheral benzodiazepine receptor\u201d (for the full list of search terms, see the  ). All TSPO PET studies in psychosis or schizophrenia that were not included are listed in   along with a detailed explanation of the selection criteria. Corresponding authors of eligible studies were contacted via e-mail, and all agreed to contribute. \n\n\n### Requested Data \n  \nRequested IPD included V  values from the frontal cortex (FC), temporal cortex (TC), and hippocampus (HIP) regions of interest (ROIs), patient\u2013control status, TSPO genotype, age, gender and medication status, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores (or equivalent), and duration of illness. These three ROIs were selected because four of five included studies had reported V  values from all of them. For the remaining study [Bloomfield   et al.   ( )], unpublished IPD V  values obtained using the conventional two-tissue compartment model from all three ROIs were provided on request, allowing for consistent pooling. To account for range differences among different radioligands used across studies, we   Z  -scored all ROI V  values within each genotype group of each study. \n\n\n### Quality Control \n  \nThe first author (PP-S) examined the integrity of the obtained IPD datasets. The data were checked for outliers and inconsistencies with the published data (such as number of participants, means, ranges, and SDs of V  and age), which were then resolved following discussion with the authors of the relevant studies. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis and Statistics \n  \nThe studies included in this meta-analysis recruited participants of two different TSPO affinity types (high-affinity binders and mixed-affinity binders), used different radioligands, and applied different image analysis procedures. To estimate the difference in V  between diagnostic groups (\u0394V ) while taking this hierarchical structure into account, we constructed and compared four different Bayesian linear mixed-effects (BLME) models of increasing complexity: In model 1 (M1), standardized ROI V  was specified as the dependent variable, diagnostic group as the fixed effect, and genotype and study as random effects with varying intercepts. Model 2 (M2) was the same as M1 but with varying slopes of the random effect of genotype (i.e., allowing for differences in \u0394V  between high-affinity binders and mixed-affinity binders). Model 3 (M3) was the same as M1 but with varying slopes of the random effect of study (i.e., allowing for differences in \u0394V  between studies). Model 4 (M4) was the same as M1 but with varying slopes for both random effects (i.e., allowing for differences in \u0394V  between genotypes and studies). The model with the best fit to data, as determined by widely applicable information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation scores, was selected ( ). \n\nFollowing model selection, we first examined the hypothesis that patients with psychosis or schizophrenia have higher levels of TSPO in the brain (hypothesis 1 [H1]). For each ROI, we quantified the relative evidence of higher TSPO expression in patients compared with the null hypothesis of no difference (H0). This was done using order-restricted Bayes factor (BF) hypothesis testing ( \u2013 ) on \u0394V . BF quantifies the relative evidence, or support, for one hypothesis over another as a ratio of their average likelihoods. A BF > 10 is usually considered as strong evidence in favor of a hypothesis (and, consequently, BF < 0.1 translates into strong evidence of the opposite hypothesis) ( ). We calculated BF  to quantify the evidence in favor of higher ROI V  in patients compared with control subjects relative to no difference. Second, we examined whether patients had lower levels of V  in the ROI (H2). Again, this was done by employing an order-restricted BF test of lower V  in patients (BF ) over no difference. Finally, we calculated the support for H2 over H1 (BF ), signaling the relative likelihood of lower levels of TSPO in patients compared with higher levels. \n\nFor each ROI, H1 and H2 were specified as half-Gaussian (normal) distributions centered on zero with a standard deviation of 0.5. Hence, to perform order-restricted hypothesis testing of patient\u2013control differences, the priors over ROI \u0394V  were specified as half Gaussians (SD = 0.5) with a lower bound of zero for H1 and an upper bound of zero for H2. The Savage\u2013Dickey ratio method was then used to calculate BFs. The standard deviation was set a priori to 0.5 because this assigns high plausibility to \u0394V  values ranging from 0 to a medium-sized difference ( , ). A medium-sized difference, corresponding to a Cohen\u2019s   d   of 0.5, was considered a reasonable prediction based on the precision of the outcome measure ( ). A medium effect size (Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.5) group difference in V  means that 69% of the patient population would be expected to have a higher (or lower) V  than the mean of the population of HCs [Cohen\u2019s U3 ( )]. \n\nA robustness check of the effect of different prior widths on BF was performed by varying the SDs of the half-Gaussian distributions (SDs = 0.2 and 0.8, corresponding to expected small and large effect sizes of \u0394V  and Cohen\u2019s U3 = 58% and 79%, respectively) when testing all hypotheses. For the prior on the SDs of the random effects, half-Cauchy distributions (with a scale of 0.707) were used. These weakly informative priors were chosen because the numbers of genotype groups (  n   = 2) and studies (  n   = 5) are small ( ). \n\nWe also estimated the overall effect size of standardized V  difference between patients and HCs. This was done using M3 with a nontruncated, weakly regularizing prior (Gaussian with an SD of 10) over the fixed effect. M3 was selected because it also allowed us to extract the study-specific effects of ROI \u0394V  (random slopes) and the corresponding SDs of these effects (\u03c4). Using these, we produced a forest plot of ROI \u0394V  and examined   \u03c4   as a measure of study heterogeneity, in line with the PRISMA-IPD guidelines. \n\nFor the secondary aim of analyzing medication effects on V , we added an additional predictor, denoting medication status, to the best-fitting BLME model. This predictor quantifies the additional effect of being medicated after controlling for patient\u2013control status. For each ROI, the prior distribution over the beta coefficient was a nontruncated Gaussian centered on zero with an SD of 10. The posterior of this predictor was then extracted together with its summary statistics (mean and 95% credible interval [CredInt]) to examine the effect of medication. \n\nWe also examined the correlation between ROI V  values and PANSS-Positive scores, PANSS-Negative scores, and duration of illness using linear effect modeling, allowing the correlations to vary between studies. All data were   Z  -transformed within study (and within genotype for V ). \n\nThe primary reason for choosing Bayesian statistical inference is that the BF allows for a direct comparison of the evidence for one hypothesis relative to another hypothesis (such as H1 against H2, i.e., higher TSPO in patients vs. lower TSPO in patients). Bayesian parameter estimation also allowed us to assess and report the uncertainty around parameters in the model, which guards against overconfidence and overfitting when making inference. For completeness, we also present frequentist equivalents of the best-fitting model, showing   p   values for patient\u2013control differences in standardized V  for each ROI in  . The Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler Stan ( ) and the R packages brms ( ) and lme4 ( ) were used for the statistical modeling in this meta-analysis. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Study Selection and Data Collection \n  \nThe PubMed search was performed on February 20, 2017, and resulted in 13 research articles. The articles were read in full by two of the authors (PP-S and SC). Both authors concluded independently that five studies ( \u2013 ) fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis (see PRISMA flowchart in  ). Each corresponding author provided anonymized individual participant V  values from FC [three studies ( \u2013 )], dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [two studies ( , )], TC (all studies), and HIP (all studies). For all subsequent analyses in this study, the V  values from FC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were considered to represent the same ROI. \n\n\n### Characteristics of Included Studies \n  \n shows demographic information, medication status, PANSS (or equivalent), and duration of illness of all participants included in this meta-analysis. In total, IPD from 75 participants with psychosis or schizophrenia and 77 HCs were included in the statistical analysis. All patients who participated in Kenk   et al.   ( ) and Bloomfield   et al.   ( ), and all patients except 2 who participated in Coughlin   et al.   ( ), were on antipsychotic treatment at the time of PET. Of the 19 patients who participated in Hafizi   et al.   ( ), 5 were antipsychotic free with less than 4 weeks of lifetime cumulative exposure and 14 were antipsychotic naive at the time of scanning. All patients in Collste   et al.   ( ) were antipsychotic naive. For all studies, exclusion criteria included clinically significant medical comorbidity and substance abuse. In two of the studies benzodiazepines were not allowed ( , ), whereas in Collste   et al.   ( ) and Kenk   et al.   ( ) the results did not change when removing subjects using benzodiazepines. Based on this information, as well as in vitro data showing effects of only high doses of diazepam on TSPO levels ( ), we chose not to include this variable in our analysis. For information on recruitment of HCs, quality control of the data, and assignment of subjects who overlapped in the original studies, see the  .   displays the individual participant ROI V  values from the five studies included in this meta-analysis. \n\nThe mean age of all subjects in the patient group was 33.88 years (SD = 12.57), and the mean age of all subjects in the HC group was 35.42 years (SD = 15.12). This corresponds to a negligible difference in age between diagnostic groups (Cohen\u2019s   d   = 0.11). Fisher\u2019s exact test indicated some skewness in gender distribution between the patient and control groups (  p   = .0504). To ascertain that any potential differences in ROI V  values between diagnostic groups in the main analysis were not driven by gender differences, we included gender as a covariate and executed an additional set of BLME models, using the same procedure as outlined in Methods and Materials. It should be noted that we had no information regarding the menstrual cycle, which could potentially influence the results in female participants, although relationships between TSPO and menstrual cycle hormonal levels have as of yet to be demonstrated. \n\n\n### Model Selection \n  \nM1 showed a slightly better fit, determined by widely applicable information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation scores, compared with M2 and M3 ( ). Therefore, we used M1 to obtain order-restricted posterior distributions of ROI \u0394V  and subsequently quantified evidence in favor of H0, H1, and H2. \n\n\n### Patient\u2013Control Difference in V  (Primary Aim) \n  \nBF  values in favor of higher V  in patients (H1) were 0.08 for FC, 0.08 for TC, and 0.06 for HIP. This translates into strong support for the null hypothesis of no difference (H0) relative to higher levels of TSPO in patients. BF  values in favor of lower V  in patients (H2) were 32.5 for FC, 34.2 for TC, and 1481.0 for HIP compared with H0. This signifies very strong evidence for the hypothesis that patients express lower TSPO levels. As a result, there was extremely strong support for H2 over H1 (BF  values: FC = 422.9; TC = 440.6; HIP = 24524.0). Hence, lower V  in patients with psychosis, as compared to with HCs, is more than 422 times more likely than higher V , conditioned on the data and the models (see   and   for all computed BFs). \n\nWhen varying the widths (SDs = 0.2 and 0.8) of the Gaussian prior distribution on the fixed effect of differences between patients and control subjects, there was still strong support in favor of H2 for all ROIs (all BF  > 15) (see  ). The addition of gender as a covariate did not change the qualitative inference for any of the ROIs (all BF  > 16) (see  ). \n\n\n### Estimation of Effect Sizes and Study Heterogeneity \n  \nFor estimation of effect sizes and study heterogeneity, M3, with an uninformative prior over \u0394V , was used.   displays forest plots of the estimated patient\u2013control difference in each study for each ROI. It also shows the posterior distributions of the standardized \u0394V  across all studies together with summary statistics (mean and credible intervals). The mean of each ROI\u2019s posterior distribution corresponded to a medium-sized (i.e., Cohen\u2019s   d   \u2248 0.5) difference in V  between patients and control subjects. When calculating group differences using raw V  values, subjects with psychosis or schizophrenia had, on average, 15% lower V  in FC, 14% lower V  in TC, and 24% lower V  in HIP compared with HCs. \n\nFor all ROIs, the SDs of the random slopes of studies (\u03c4) were very small (posterior modes < 0.04; posterior means < 0.22) and   I   < 15%, signifying low study heterogeneity in \u0394V  differences (see  ). \n\n\n### Effect of Medication (Secondary Aim) \n  \nWe examined the effect of medication on V  by adding medication status as an additional predictor to M1. For all ROIs, the models showed little to no evidence of a medication effect, allocating as much probability to higher V  as they did to lower V . The means of the posterior over the difference in standardized V  due to medication were 0.009 for FC (CredInt = \u22120.384 to 0.401), \u22120.013 for TC (CredInt = \u22120.407 to 0.381), and \u22120.040 for HIP (CredInt = \u22120.423 to 0.343) (see  ). Thus, no support was found for a difference in TSPO levels between drug-free and medicated patients. \n\nThere was little to no evidence for a correlation between regional V  values and PANSS-Positive scores, PANSS-Negative scores, or duration of illness (see   and   and   and  ). \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThe main finding of this IPD meta-analysis was that patients with schizophrenia and first-episode psychosis showed lower levels of the glial cell marker TSPO compared with HCs. Using BLME modeling, we observed very strong evidence of lower levels of TSPO, measured using V , in FC, TC, and HIP, contrary to the hypothesis of higher TSPO in patients. As such, this study constitutes the most conclusive in vivo investigation of TSPO in psychosis to date. \n\nAntipsychotic medication has been shown to attenuate blood cytokine levels in patients ( ) as well as to inhibit immune cell activity in vitro ( ). Although the effect on TSPO expression in animals is less conclusive ( ), these observations suggest that TSPO levels could be lower in medicated subjects compared with unmedicated subjects. However, our secondary analysis of the effect of medication status yielded no evidence for such a difference in radioligand binding between drug-free and medicated patients. This indicates that the observed lower levels of TSPO in patients is not an effect of exposure to antipsychotic treatment. \n\nA wealth of data has demonstrated higher levels of proinflammatory markers, such as cytokines, in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma in patients across disease stages of schizophrenia ( , ). In the brain, these signaling molecules are mainly released by microglia and astrocytes, which have key roles in the immune response ( ). Therefore, increases in numbers or activity of these cells in schizophrenia have been hypothesized ( , ). In postmortem studies, higher levels of brain glial cell markers, such as human leukocyte antigen\u2013antigen D related and CD11b, have been observed in patients, although results have been mixed ( \u2013 ). With regard to astrocyte markers, there is no evidence of any overall differences between patients and control subjects ( , ). In the case of TSPO, which is expressed in microglia and astrocytes among other cells ( , , ), autoradiographic studies have reported both higher ( ) and lower ( ) binding in patients as compared with HCs. Important caveats when interpreting these studies are that the age of patients and control subjects is generally high and the cause of death in patients is often suicide ( ). A recent translational study examined TSPO in an infection-mediated animal model of schizophrenia. Higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines were found in brain regions that also showed lower TSPO expression as measured using immunohistochemistry ( ), an observation that paralleled TSPO PET and cerebrospinal fluid data in patients ( ). Importantly, microglia and astrocytes have been found to exist in both pro- and anti-inflammatory states ( , ), which cannot be differentiated by TSPO. Indeed, very recent in vitro data suggest that M1 (proinflammatory) macrophages and microglia may show lower TSPO expression in humans ( , ). The above-discussed literature, together with the results of our study, challenges the utility of TSPO as an exclusively proinflammatory marker in schizophrenia. Lower levels of TSPO could indicate a compensatory mechanism to a proinflammatory signal ( , ) or altered function of glial cells such as abnormal energy use ( ). Because stimulation of TSPO has been shown to attenuate microglial activation in response to neuroinflammatory challenges ( \u2013 ), lower TSPO in psychosis could also indicate an inherent weaker anti-inflammatory response. These hypotheses all need to be addressed in future studies. \n\nBecause there is no brain region devoid of TSPO expression ( , ), metabolite-corrected arterial plasma measurements of radioligand concentration are necessary for accurate in vivo quantification of binding. To overcome variability that may be associated with the arterial measurements ( , ), relative measures of binding, such as distribution volume ratios (DVRs), have been proposed ( ). Of the studies included in this meta-analysis, one study reported a significantly higher DVR in patients with schizophrenia and people at clinical risk for psychosis ( ), whereas three studies showed no difference in schizophrenia ( \u2013 ). More recently, one study found no evidence of higher DVR in high-risk individuals compared with HCs ( ). We chose not to include DVR in our analysis. The interpretation of patient\u2013control differences obtained by dividing binding in a target region by that in a reference region is complicated by the possibility that there are alterations in specific binding in the reference region as well. In addition, the reliability of DVR for TSPO radioligands has been found to be low ( ). Given the lack of a true reference region, V  is the most suitable outcome for TSPO quantification under the assumption that nondisplaceable binding does not differ between groups. Apart from glial cells, TSPO is also expressed in perivascular and endothelial cells ( , ) and under certain conditions also neurons ( ). Further research is needed to evaluate the contribution of these components to the observation of lower levels of V  in schizophrenia. Finally, while there is as yet no published evidence showing an effect of the fraction of free radiotracer in plasma on brain V  for TSPO radioligands ( ), it cannot be ruled out that potential patient\u2013control differences in free radiotracer might contribute to the observed differences in V . Of all the original studies included in this meta-analysis that measured free radiotracer ( \u2013 ), none found a significant difference between groups, suggesting that this factor did not have a major influence on the results. \n\nIn this IPD meta-analysis, the hierarchal statistical models allowed us to investigate the difference in TSPO levels between patients with psychosis and HCs across five different studies. The IPD approach offers many advantages over traditional, aggregated meta-analysis ( ). In this study specifically, for example, it allowed us to examine the effect of medication, investigate correlations between V  and clinical measures, and control for potential cofounders such as gender, all of which would not have been possible if effect sizes had only been extracted from literature. By including only studies employing second-generation radiotracers and reporting the standard outcome measure V , the analysis fulfills the precondition of meta-analytical models that outcomes should stem from the same underlying distribution of effects. Synthesizing data in this way, we were able to overcome the critical limitation of small sample sizes in the individual reports. Despite this, the total number of included subjects did not allow for investigations of specific subgroups such as different disease stages. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe current study shows that TSPO levels are lower across several brain regions in patients with first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia compared with HCs, suggesting an altered function, or reduced density, of immune and glial cells. Further work is needed to assess the exact biological meaning of these changes using both clinical and translational studies. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7893597, "text_md5": "6f86fcbf30ce533a6b7927950d7fde9c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 257], "journal": [258, 273], "publication_year": [275, 279], "title": [290, 450], "keywords": [464, 580], "abstract": [593, 2443], "body": [2452, 28517]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 29653835, "doi": "10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.02.1171", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893597", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7893597"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893597\">7893597</a>", "list_title": "PMC7893597  Positron Emission Tomography Studies of the Glial Cell Marker Translocator Protein in Patients With Psychosis: A Meta-analysis Using Individual Participant Data"}

The aim of our meta-analysis was to identify concordant regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in patients with T2DM. \n\n Methods:   A systematic search was conducted to identify voxel-based rs-fMRI studies comparing T2DM patients with healthy controls. The permutation of subject images seed-based   d   mapping (SDM) was used to quantitatively estimate the regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in patients with T2DM. Metaregression was conducted to examine the associations between clinical characteristics and functional alterations. \n\n Results:   A total of 16 studies with 19 datasets including 434 patients with T2DM and 391 healthy controls were included. Patients with T2DM showed hypoactivity in the right medial superior frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and left lingual gyrus, whereas hyperactivity in the right cerebellum. Metaregression analysis identified negative correlation between regional activity in the medial superior frontal and anterior cingulate gyri and illness duration of patients with T2DM. \n\n Conclusion:   The patterns of regional spontaneous neural activity alterations, characterized by hypoactivity in the medial pre-frontal cortex, visual cortex, and superior temporal gyrus, whereas hyperactivity in the cerebellum, might represent the underlying neuropathological mechanisms of T2DM. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, leading to long-term macrovascular and microvascular complications of various organ systems, including multiple central nervous system deficits, which are often associated with dementia, cognitive deterioration, and emotional dysfunctions (Kodl and Seaquist,  ; Moheet et al.,  ; Thakur et al.,  ). Growing evidence does show that the cognitive decrements in T2DM patients appear to be attributable to brain structural and functional alterations (van Harten et al.,  ; Moran et al.,  ). \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool to study the brain mechanism underlying the cognitive dysfunction of diabetes with quantitative measures. In recent decades, there is a growing interest of the use of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to study the neurophysiological mechanism of T2DM because of its non-invasive and task-free nature. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF)/fractional ALFF (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) are two methods commonly used for characterizing local spontaneous neural activity of rs-fMRI data (Zuo and Xing,  ). The ALFF in the blood oxygenation level\u2013dependent signal has been correlated with local field potential activity (Logothetis et al.,  ), and the fALFF is strongly coupled with ALFF and quantifies the amplitude of these low-frequency oscillations (Zou et al.,  ). The ReHo is thought to reflect the similarity or synchronization between the time series of a given voxel and its nearest neighbors (Zang et al.,  ). In rs-fMRI studies, ALFF/fALFF and ReHo are usually used in \u201cwhole-brain voxel-wise\u201d analysis with very similar preprocessing parameters across studies. Synthetically, the ALFF/fALFF and ReHo provide complementary information about the regional spontaneous brain activity (Xu et al.,  ). \n\nUsing the ALFF/fALFF and ReHo, regional spontaneous neural activity deficits in T2DM have been widely reported. However, they have produced inconsistent results. For example, increased regional activity has been found in the lingual gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and precuneus (Wang et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ; Wang Z. L. et al.,  ; Liu Y. et al.,  ), whereas decreased activity in these regions has also been reported (Xia et al.,  ; Cui et al.,  ; Wang Y. F. et al.,  ), and yet more studies have identified no changes (Liu et al.,  ; Liao et al.,  ; Liu D. et al.,  ). This inconsistency resulted in part from small samples and from studying patients with various comorbidities, such as microangiopathy, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy (Xia et al.,  ; Cui et al.,  ; Wang Z. L. et al.,  ; Liao et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ); vitreous hemorrhage (Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ); mild cognitive impairment (Zhou et al.,  ; Xiong et al.,  ); cirrhosis (Wang Y. F. et al.,  ); hypertension (Cui et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ); and dyslipidemia (Wang et al.,  ), which were known to alter brain function (Weissenborn et al.,  ; Umegaki et al.,  ; Umemura et al.,  ; Friedman et al.,  ; Muela et al.,  ). Thus, the central question of how the brain regional function manifests remains unaddressed in T2DM. \n\nAs a complex statistical method, meta-analysis involves the synthesis of data from relevant studies to identify an effect or draw a conclusion, and this approach can justify and refine hypotheses for various diseases (Mak et al.,  ). Comparing to the image-based meta-analysis, which requires the full image information, the peak probability meta-analysis methods such as seed-based   d   mapping (SDM, formerly Signed Differential Mapping) and activation likelihood estimation (ALE) are more feasible owing to they only using the peak coordinates. SDM adopted various positive features from previous methods such as ALE and multilevel kernel density analysis (MDKA), and introduced a series of improvements and novel features (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). For example, SDM represents both positive and negative differences in the same map, thereby preventing a particular voxel from appearing to be significant in opposite directions (Radua et al.,  ). Another relevant feature is the use of effect sizes, which allows combination of reported peak coordinates with statistical parametric maps, thus allowing more exhaustive and accurate meta-analysis (Radua et al.,  ). Additionally, SDM enables several complementary analyses, such as subgroup and metaregression analyses, that can be used to assess the robustness and heterogeneity of the results (Radua et al.,  ). A previous meta-analysis in T2DM using ALE reported widespread brain function alterations including reduced activity in the lingual, postcentral, inferior temporal, cerebellar, insular, and posterior cingulate cortices as well as increased activity in the precuneus and superior frontal gyrus (Xia et al.,  ). However, this study involved functional connectivity measurements in addition to regional activity, and also included perfusion modality using arterial spin labeling (ASL). \n\nTherefore, using a permutation of subject images seed-based   d   mapping (PSI-SDM) as primary tool, the aim of this study was to conduct a quantitative, voxel-based meta-analysis of whole-brain rs-fMRI studies in T2DM to investigate the regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities and explore the potential effects of the clinical and demographic characteristics on these functional alterations. Although both ALFF/fALFF and ReHo measured the local activity of each voxel, previous studies found that ALFF and ReHo revealed convergent local activity alterations in some brain regions and also divergent brain regions with abnormal activity (Cui et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ). Hence, both combined and separate meta-analyses on ALFF/fALFF and ReHo were performed in this study. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Selection of Studies \n  \nA systematic search was conducted for relevant studies in the PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and EMBASE databases before December 31, 2020, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines (Moher et al.,  ). The key search words were (\u201cdiabetes\u201d or \u201cdiabetic\u201d), (\u201camplitude of low-frequency fluctuation\u201d or \u201cALFF\u201d or \u201cfALFF\u201d or \u201cregional homogeneity\u201d or \u201cReHo\u201d), and (\u201cmagnetic resonance\u201d or \u201cMRI\u201d or \u201cfMRI\u201d). Besides, manual searches were conducted among the reference sections of the retrieved studies and suitable reviews. Studies were considered to be eligible according to the following criteria: (1) comparison of patients with T2DM with healthy controls; (2) using voxel-based analysis to investigate ALFF, fALFF, or ReHo changes in the entire brain or entire gray matter; (3) reporting of whole-brain results in a stereotactic space (Montreal Neurological Institute or Talairach); (4) published in English as an article. The corresponding authors were asked via email to send any additional data that were not included in the original publications. To minimize data entry error, all data from the initially retrieved studies were extracted by two radiologists. For each included study, we recorded the following: sample size, gender, age, education, illness duration, onset age, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A  (HbA )%, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, scanner, acquisition parameters for rs-fMRI, software packages, and analytic methods. \n\n\n### Voxel-Based Meta-Analysis \n  \nVoxel-based meta-analyses of regional brain differences were conducted with PSI-SDM software package ( , version 6.21). The procedures included the data preparation, preprocessing, mean analysis, and statistic test in brief. \n\nIn the data preparation, the peak coordinates and   t   values were written in a text file for each study. The studies with non\u2013statistically significant unreported effects (NSUEs) were also included, and their text files were recorded with no content and named with the extension of \u201c.no_peaks.txt\u201d In the preprocessing, PSI-SDM first estimated the lower and upper bounds of possible effect-size images for the contrast between patients and controls from peak coordinates and effect sizes for each study separately. Second, PSI-SDM performed the meta-analysis of NSUE (MetaNSUE) based on maximum likelihood estimation and multiple imputation algorithm, which could include studies with NSUEs and was substantially less biased than previous versions of SDM. Briefly, PSI-SDM used the MetaNSUE to estimate the most likely effect size and its standard error and to create several imputations based on adding noise to these estimations within the bounds for each study (with or without NSUEs). Default number of imputations in PSI-SDM was used in this study (  n   = 50) (Radua et al.,  ; Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  , ). In the mean analysis, PSI-SDM conducted a random-effects meta-analysis for each imputed dataset and then used Rubin's rules to combine the coefficients and their covariance and the heterogeneity statistics   I   and   Q   of these imputed datasets (Li et al.,  ; Radua et al.,  ; Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  ). In the statistical test, subject images were recreated in order to run a standard permutation test, in which the process was repeated with each set of permuted images. Statistical significance was determined by the maximum statistic from the images derived from the permuted images (voxel   p   < 0.005, peak height   z   = 1, cluster extent = 10 voxels) (Radua et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Subgroup Analysis \n  \nTo both establish consistency of findings and to identify measurements associated with divergent finding, we further performed secondary subgroup analyses to characterize brain regional function abnormalities within studies using ALFF/fALFF and ReHo separately. \n\n\n### Metaregression Analysis \n  \nThe potential effects of relevant demographic and clinical variables were examined by a random-effects general linear metaregression. The independent variables explored by the metaregression were mean age, percentage of males, education, illness duration, onset age, HbA %, BMI, and MMSE scores in patients with T2DM. The dependent variable was the SDM-  Z   value. The metaregression analyses were performed for studies using ALFF/fALFF and ReHo separately as well as their combinations. As reported in a previous study, we decreased the probability threshold to 0.0005 to reduce spurious results (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). In the findings of whole-brain metaregression analysis, the regions that did not overlap with those in the main between-group analysis were discarded. Finally, regression plots were visually inspected to discard fittings driven by few studies (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ; Radua et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Heterogeneity and Publication Bias Analyses \n  \nThe between-studies heterogeneity of individual clusters was tested using a random-effects model. Magnitude of heterogeneity was estimated using   I   index, computed as 100% \u00d7 (  Q   \u2013   df  )/  Q  , where   df   is the degree of freedom, which estimates the proportion of variability due to non-random differences between studies. Funnel plots of significant clusters were also created by Egger tests (Egger et al.,  ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Included Studies and Sample Characteristics \n  \nA total of 47 articles were identified through the systematic literature search, and   shows the details of study selection process. We finally included 16 studies (19 T2DM datasets and 15 healthy controls datasets) in the final meta-analysis (Xia et al.,  ; Cui et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ,  ; Zhou et al.,  ; Liu et al.,  ; Peng et al.,  ; Wang Y. F. et al.,  ; Wang Z. L. et al.,  ; Liao et al.,  ; Liu D. et al.,  ; Liu Y. et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ; Xiong et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ). In two studies of ReHo, the analysis was performed in two different T2DM subgroups (Peng et al.,  ; Xiong et al.,  ), and in another study, the analysis was performed with ALFF and ReHo (Cui et al.,  ). Besides, two studies used the same sample but analyzed two different measurements (Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ). For these studies involving multiple independent patient subgroups or different measurements, the group coordinates were treated as separate datasets in the meta-analysis. \n  \nLiterature search and study selection flowchart.

Acquisition parameters for rs-fMRI images, software packages, and analytic methods of all included studies are presented in the  . Patient groups were age- and sex-matched to control groups when combining the datasets. Specifically, the mean age was 56.7 \u00b1 8.2 years old in the T2DM group vs. 55.8 \u00b1 7.3 years old in the control group. \n  \nDemographic and clinical characteristics of the included studies in the meta-analysis. \n  \n SD, standard deviation; BMI, body mass index; MMSE, Mini Mental State Examination; ALFF, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; fALFF, fractional ALFF; ReHo, regional homogeneity; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; NA, not available  . \n  \n\n### PSI-SDM Meta-Analysis \n  \nCoordinates for the meta-analyses were obtained from 18 datasets, and only one dataset had NSUE (Xiong et al.,  ). Patients with T2DM showed significant regional hypoactivity in the right medial superior frontal gyrus compared with healthy controls ( ,  ). No significant regional hyperactivity was found between patients with T2DM and healthy controls. \n  \nMeta-analysis results for patients with T2DM relative to healthy controls. \n  \n T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus; ALFF, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations; fALFF, fractional ALFF; ReHo, regional homogeneity; MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; SDM, seed-based d mapping; R, right; L, left  . \n    \nMeta-analysis results of regions with resting-state function alterations in type 2 diabetes mellitus relative to healthy controls.

However, there were two outliers at the longest illness duration in the regression plot ( ). When excluding the two datasets (Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ), no significant association was found between the illness duration and regional activity in patients with T2DM. The mean age, percentage of males, education, onset age, HbA %, BMI, and MMSE scores were not linearly associated with regional function alteration in patients with T2DM. \n  \nMetaregression analysis results.

The Egger test of funnel plot asymmetry did not identify any publication bias in any cluster (all   p   > 0.05). Detailed results of heterogeneity and publication bias analyses are provided in the  . \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present meta-analysis identified regional spontaneous neural activity alterations in patients with T2DM, including hypoactivity in the right medial superior frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and left lingual gyrus, and hyperactivity in the right cerebellum. The novel findings of this study were hypoactivity in the medial superior frontal gyrus and hyperactivity in the cerebellum, which were inconsistent to previous meta-analysis (Xia et al.,  ). \n\nThe medial frontal cortex is a key part of the default mode network (DMN) and has been mainly implicated in value-based decision-making, regulation of negative emotion, self-perception, and social cognitive function (Bechara et al.,  ; Smith et al.,  ; Roy et al.,  ; Delgado et al.,  ; Hiser and Koenigs,  ). The dysfunction of DMN was associated with the deficits in neurocognitive performance and episodic memory in patients with T2DM (Cui et al.,  ; Chen et al.,  ). We also identified negative correlation between regional activity in the medial superior frontal and anterior cingulate gyri and illness duration of patients with T2DM. This finding was consistent with previous studies that reported association between diabetic duration and structural and functional abnormalities in the medial pre-frontal cortex, such as gray matter atrophy (Garcia-Casares et al.,  ), white matter deficits (Hsu et al.,  ), decreased glucose metabolism (Garcia-Casares et al.,  ), and reduced functional connectivity (Liu et al.,  ). Besides, the hypoactivity in the medial pre-frontal cortex was found to correlate with diabetic microvascular disease (Wang et al.,  ), which was consistent with the observation of reduced cerebral blood flow in this region (Dai et al.,  ; Bangen et al.,  ). These findings suggested the functional alterations in the medial pre-frontal cortex might be the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive deficits associated with cerebral small vessel disease in T2DM (Nelson et al.,  ; Umemura et al.,  ) and exacerbated with the progression of disease course (Korf et al.,  ). However, it should be noted that the correlation between regional function in the medial pre-frontal cortex and diabetic duration in our metaregression was not significant when excluding two outliers at long illness duration. As diabetic duration was found to be associated with the risk of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (Chen et al.,  ) and stroke (Banerjee et al.,  ), the longer disease duration might lead to the increased mortality (Maser et al.,  ; Pop-Busui et al.,  ). Thus, the potential survival bias might account for the lack of long diabetic duration sample. The robustness of association between regional function in the medial pre-frontal cortex and illness duration in T2DM needs to be further identified. \n\nThe cerebellum controls motor coordination and execution. Previous laboratory studies found the association between motor deficits and the cerebellar damage in diabetic rats (Sherin et al.,  ; Nagayach et al.,  ). The cerebellum dysfunctions also related to impaired cognition in patients with T2DM as structural and functional connectivity alterations were found in the cerebellar and cerebrocerebellar circuits (Fang et al.,  ; Zhang D. et al.,  ). The hyperactivity in the cerebellum might be a recruitment of additional neural resources to compensate for loss of cognitive function in the cerebral regions (Xia et al.,  ). \n\nThe regional hypoactivity in the left lingual gyrus extending to calcarine fissure/surrounding cortex and right superior temporal gyrus extending to insula was consistent with a previous meta-analysis (Xia et al.,  ). The lingual and calcarine surrounding gyri are key components of the visual cortex. Visuospatial dysfunction was common in T2DM (Moran et al.,  ), and the hypoactivity in the lingual gyrus was also correlated with impaired cognitive performance (Cui et al.,  ). The superior temporal gyrus is linked to language processing, which may be impaired by dysglycemia (Allen et al.,  ). The insula is an integral region in the salience network (Menon and Uddin,  ), and hypoactivity may cause deficits in generation of appropriate behavioral responses to stimuli in patients with T2DM. \n\nThe present study showed some inconsistencies with previous meta-analysis (Xia et al.,  ). Our meta-analysis revealed hypoactivity in the right medial superior frontal gyrus and hyperactivity in the right hemispheric cerebellum, whereas previous meta-analysis revealed hyperactivity in the left medial superior frontal gyrus and hypoactivity in the right cerebellar culmen. There were several possible reasons accounting for the discrepancy. First, the former meta-analysis included only five original studies and seven datasets that investigated the regional functional activity alterations using ALFF/fALFF and ReHo. Our study with a larger sample included 16 original studies and 19 datasets, and many of the newly included studies reported hypoactivity in the medial superior frontal gyrus (Liu et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ) and hyperactivity in the cerebellum (Liao et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ; Qi et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ; Zhang Y. Q. et al.,  ). Second, the previous meta-analysis included both regional activity and functional connectivity measurements as well as perfusion modality, whereas this meta-analysis enrolled only studies using ALFF/fALFF and ReHo indices reflecting the regional spontaneous neural activity, avoiding heterogeneity of the included studies (Xia et al.,  ). Third, we performed this meta-analysis using a newly developed tool with nearly unbiased algorithm to estimate effect size (Albajes-Eizagirre et al.,  ). \n\nSeveral limitations should also be noted. First, as many original studies included patients with comorbidity, the effect of comorbidity on the regional functional activity alterations could not be assessed. Second, the combined analysis of ALFF/fALFF and ReHo datasets and subgroup analysis of ALFF/fALFF or ReHo datasets showed functional activity alterations in divergent regions. Thus, the different measurements might contribute to the heterogeneity of regional spontaneous neural dysfunction. Third, we detected relationship between functional activity alteration and diabetic duration; however, all the included studies were cross-sectional. Besides, this relationship was not significant when excluding two outliers at long illness duration. Thus, the metaregression result should be considered cautiously and further identified. \n\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis identified concordant regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in patients with T2DM, characterized by hypoactivity in the medial pre-frontal cortex, visual cortex, and superior temporal gyrus, whereas hyperactivity in the cerebellum. These findings might represent the underlying neuropathological mechanisms of T2DM. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nJL and PZ conceived and designed the study.

However, its added value compared with conventional 1.5T and 3.0T MRI is unclear. We reviewed the evidence for the use of 7 Tesla MRI in patients with epilepsy and compared the detection rate of focal lesions with clinical MRI. \n\n Methods:   Clinical retrospective case studies were identified using the indexed text terms \u201cepilepsy\u201d AND \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cMR imaging\u201d AND \u201c7T\u201d OR \u201c7 Tesla\u201d OR \u201c7T\u201d in Medline (2002-September 1, 2020) and Embase (1999-September 1, 2020). The study setting, MRI protocols, qualitative, and quantitative assessment were systematically reviewed. The detection rate of morphologic abnormalities on MRI was reported in each study in which surgery was used as the reference standard. Meta-analyses were performed using a univariate random-effects model in diagnostic performance studies with patients that underwent both 7T MRI and conventional MRI. \n\n Results:   Twenty-five articles were included (467 patients and 167 healthy controls) consisting of 10 case studies, 10 case-control studies, 4 case series, and 1 cohort study. All studies included focal epilepsy; 12 studies (12/25, 48%) specified the disease etiology and 4 studies reported focal but non-lesional (MRI-negative on 1.5/3.0T) epilepsy. 7T MRI showed superior detection and delineation of morphologic abnormalities in all studies. In nine comparative studies, 7T MRI had a superior detection rate of 65% compared with the 22% detection rate of 1.5T or 3.0T. \n\n Significance:   7T MRI is useful for delineating morphologic abnormalities with a higher detection rate compared with conventional clinical MRI. Most studies were conducted using a case series or case study; therefore, a cohort study design with clinical outcomes is necessary. \n\n Classification of Evidence:   Class IV Criteria for Rating Diagnostic Accuracy Studies. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Key Points: \n    \n- In a systematic review, 7T MRI showed superior detection and delineation of morphologic details compared with conventional 1.5T or 3.0T MRI. \n  \n- 7T showed a superior detection rate of 65% compared with a 22% detection rate for 1.5T or 3.0T MRI. \n  \n- A cohort study in patients with epilepsy is necessary to evaluate the diagnostic performance of 7T MRI. \n  \n\n## Introduction \n  \nApproximately 20\u201340% of individuals with epilepsy do not respond to anti-seizure drug therapy ( ). The most effective operative management involves a focal cortical resection with excision of the epileptogenic cortex and analysis of the underlying pathologic findings ( ). Chronic focal epilepsy includes mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), focal cortical dysplasia, neoplastic lesions, cavernous hemangioma, remote cerebral infarction, and posttraumatic encephalomalacia ( ). In cases of focal lesional epilepsy, resective surgery is the most effective treatment that allows patients to become seizure-free, improving their quality of life ( ). \n\nHowever, 20\u201330% of patients with focal epilepsy are \u201cMRI-negative\u201d on clinical MRI, meaning that they do not have an identifiable lesion on 1.5T or 3.0T MRI ( ,  ). Advances in imaging techniques by 7 Tesla MRI might improve the visualization of smaller anatomical structures and allow detailed pathological findings with a high spatial resolution by reducing the voxel size related to the increased signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio ( ,  ). Another important benefit is the detection of cortical gray matter lesions ( ). Because a significant proportion of surgical candidates has no relevant structural MRI abnormalities on 1.5T or 3.0T MRI, the introduction of 7 Tesla MRI techniques and diagnostic tools might provide a better surgical outcomes in these patients ( ,  ). \n\nAlong with the increasing recognition of 7T MRI in patients with epilepsy, several studies have reviewed the clinical value of 7T MRI ( ,  ,  ). However, no studies have quantified the diagnostic value of 7T MRI in comparison with conventional 1.5T or 3.0T MRI. A unifying evidence-based systematic summary of clinical studies might reveal the clinical value of 7T MRI. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published clinical reports to determine the added value of 7T compared with the diagnostic performance of 1.5T or 3T MRI and to analyze the diagnostic value of 7T MRI in patients with epilepsy. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Article Search Strategy and Study Selection \n  \nThe systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis\u2013Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines ( ). The search terms used to find studies were \u201cepilepsy\u201d AND \u201cmagnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cMR imaging\u201d AND \u201c7T\u201d OR \u201c7Tesla\u201d OR \u201c7T\u201d in the MEDLINE (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and EMBASE databases. The inclusion process is shown in  . From 199 identified articles, 135 remained after the removal of duplicates. Screening of the abstracts was performed, and 68 non-epilepsy studies, 14 review articles, 9 technical notes, 3 non-MRI studies, 3 non-7T studies, and 1 case report were excluded. Only articles published in English were reviewed. Full-text reviews of the remaining 37 potentially eligible articles were performed by two experienced reviewers working in consensus (J.E.P. and W.H.S., with 11 and 26 years of experience in radiology). In this process, 6   ex-vivo   studies and 6 atlas or illustration articles were excluded. Finally, 25 articles were included in the main analysis, which consisted of 10 articles reporting a diagnostic performance study. \n  \nFlow diagram of the study selection process. \n  \n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nStudy quality was measured using the Newcastle Ottawa scale ( ) for cohorts and modifications for case-control studies and case series that converged into eight items that could be categorized into three domains: selection, confounder, and outcome for cohort studies and selection, comparability, and exposure for case-control studies and case series. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nAll articles were reviewed by two independent board-certified radiologists and the following general data were extracted: first author, journal, year of publication, characteristics of patients with epilepsy, type of epilepsy, age, and sex at epilepsy onset. The age and sex of controls were recorded. MRI protocols and parameters were recorded as well as whether structural and functional MRI were performed. The study design was recorded as case series/case study, case control, or cohort study ( ). When there were quantitative parameters, these values were extracted from the main text, tables, or figures. In studies that included healthy controls, the quantitative parameters of the healthy controls were collected separated. \n\nEpilepsy type was followed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of seizures and epilepsy ( ). Epilepsy type included generalized epilepsy, focal epilepsy, combined generalized and focal epilepsy, and unknown. Then, epilepsy with structural etiology included mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis, hypothalamic hamartoma, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), polymicrogyria, and tuberous sclerosis, or acquired structural etiology including hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, stroke, trauma, or infection ( ). Focal epilepsy included both lesional and non-lesional epilepsy, and epilepsy with clear structural etiologies were recorded as lesional. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nIn 9 studies reporting a detection rate, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the epileptogenic zone when comparing 7T with 1.5T/3.T MRI. The pooled detection rate for focal lesions in patients with epilepsy was obtained by the Hartung-Knapp adjustment for random-effects models ( ). Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Higgins inconsistency index (  I  ) test and Cochran Q test ( ), and   P   < 0.1 in the Q test and   I   values >50% were considered to indicate significant heterogeneity ( ). Publication bias was assessed by a funnel plot and Begg test, and a   P   < 0.1 in the Begg test indicated significant publication bias. All statistical analyses were performed using the \u201cmeta\u201d package in R software (version 3.6.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) by an expert statistician (L.J.S. with 10 years of experience). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study Characteristics and Quality Assessment \n  \nOur search process is shown in  . The basic characteristics of the 25 articles included in this study are summarized in  . The studies were published in 2011 (1 article), 2013 (1 article), 2015 (1 article), 2016 (6 articles), 2017 (5 articles), 2018 (5 articles), 2019 (4 articles), and 2020 (2 articles). There were 467 patients and the mean patient number was 18.9 (standard deviation, 12.5; range, 6\u201366), with a mean age of 30.1 years (standard deviation, 7) with 216 men except for 2 studies with no information regarding age and sex. There were 167 healthy controls with a mean age of 32.3 years (standard deviation, 7) with 75 men and 1 study with no information regarding age and sex. Ten studies included pediatric patients. \n  \nBaseline characteristics of 25 studies with 7T MRI included in this analysis. \n  \n FSPGR, fast-spoiled gradient echo; MPRAGE, magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo; MP2RAGE, variation of magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo; TLE, Temporal lobe epilepsy; FCD, Focal cortical dysplasia; yr, year; N = number  . \n  \nStructural MRI included high-resolution T1, T2, and susceptibility-weighted imaging and functional MRI included diffusion tensor imaging (  n   = 4), functional MRI (  n   = 2), and MR spectroscopy (  n   = 2). Study design included 10 case studies, 10 case-control studies, 4 case series, and 1 cohort study. \n\nRegarding epilepsy type, all studies included focal or combined generalized and focal epilepsy (25/25 studies). Of these, four studies included patients with focal but non-lesional epilepsy (MRI-negative) on 1.5T or 3.0T. Twelve studies (12/25, 48%) specified the etiology; of these, 6 included TLE (6/25, 24%), 4 included FCD (4/25, 16%), 1 study included polymicrogyria, and 1 study included tuberous sclerosis. \n\nStudy quality was measured with the Newcastle Ottawa scale ranging from 1 to 6 ( ). Most studies lost points as they did not include independent validation in addition to an unclear non-response rate. \n\n\n### Systematic Review for Qualitative Assessment Using Structural MRI on 7T \n  \nA summary of studies according to the study endpoint, studies for meta-analysis, reliability or descriptive analyses, and potential imaging biomarkers is shown in  . Qualitative assessment of morphologic characteristics on structural MRI protocols was performed for 16 studies (64%), of which a scoring system was assessed in 7 studies and the detection rate was assessed in 9 studies. In all studies with a scoring system ( \u2013 ), 7T MRI scored higher than 3T MRI for lesion conspicuity of morphologic characteristics and/or reader's confidence ( ). The inter-rater agreement of the diagnostic confidence scale was higher on 7T (92.3%) than on 3T (57.7%) ( ). \n  \nSummary of 7T Epilepsy Study on 7T according to study endpoint. \n  \n HIA, hippocampal asymmetry score; N, number; FA, fractional anisotropy; MK, mean kurtosis; CNR, contrast-to-noise ratio; SNR, signal-to-noise ratio; NAA, N-acetylacetate  . \n  \nThe lesion conspicuity was higher on descriptive studies of 7T using high-resolution T1-weighted imaging of magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) and SWI. The signs of TLE include abnormal hippocampal digitations, size differences (atrophy), abnormality of shape, and increased signal ( ). \n\nThe signs of FCD include increased cortical thickness, cortical thinning, abnormal sulcation, regional hypoplasia/atrophy, transmantle sign, blurring of the gray/white matter junction, T2-weighted hyperintensity, and T1-weighted hypointensity in subcortical white matter. The diagnostic confidence was superior in 7 of 14 items on 7T compared with 3T ( ). \n\nFor tuberous sclerosis ( ), 7T detected tuber extension beyond the margins identified on conventional 3 T MR images, which offered a better delineation of cortical abnormalities. \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis of the Detection Rate of 7T Compared With 3T \n  \nNine studies assessed the detection rate of lesional epilepsy ( \u2013 ), of which 9 studies (160 patients) reported a detection rate on 7T and 8 studies (152 patients) reported a detection rate on 3T ( ). According to the meta-analysis of 9 studies, the overall detection rate of 7T MRI was 65% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 42 %, 85%) ( ) while that of 3T MRI was 22% (95% CI: 3%, 54%) ( ). The analysis revealed heterogeneity for 7T (  I   = 85.6%) and 3T (  I   = 91.2%). A funnel plot revealed no publication bias in data of both 7T and 3T (both   P   > 0.01, Begg test) ( ). \n  \nForest plots show the comparison of the detection rate on 3.0T   (A)   and 7.0T   (B)   MRI. Overall detection rates of 7T and 3T MRI are 65 and 22%, respectively, showing a statistically significant difference. \n  \nThe overall detection rate was 33% higher by 7T compared with 3T. There was new bilateral detection of polymicrogyria ( ), as well as new detections of FCD ( ,  ,  ,  ) and hippocampal abnormalities ( ,  ,  ). Of note, susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) demonstrated leptomeningeal venous abnormalities ( ) or intracortical black line signs ( ), which is associated with overlying focal cortical dysplasia. One study showed a histopathologic correlation between a negative finding on 7T and an epileptogenic lesion (gliosis) ( ). \n\n\n### Systematic Review of Quantitative Assessment and Potential Imaging Biomarkers on 7T \n  \nQuantitative assessment for potential imaging biomarkers was available for 10 studies (10/25, 40%) including 4 studies with hippocampal volumetry ( ,  ,  ,  ), 3 studies with diffusion tensor parameters ( ) or fiber tracking ( ,  ) on DTI, 2 studies with metabolites from MR spectroscopy ( ,  ), 1 study with vessel density ( ), 1 study with perivascular space ( ), and 1 study with functional MRI ( ). \n\nHippocampal volumetry was quantitatively measured in hippocampal subfields in all volumetric studies ( ,  ,  ,  ), and identified selectively greater ipsilateral Ammon horn atrophy ( ) and CA1 and CA4+dentate gyrus atrophy ( ) in patients with TLE. High-angular-resolved diffusion-weighted imaging revealed lower u-fiber counts in subjects with epilepsy ( ) compared with healthy controls. Hippocampal tractography demonstrated patients with left temporal seizure focus ( ), exhibited increased connectivity of certain ipsilateral subfields, especially the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum, and reduced connectivity for contralateral subfields, such as CA1 and subiculum. \n\nWith improved contrast and resolution, the depiction of the perivascular space was significantly improved on 7T using axial T2-weighted TSE sequences ( ). In a case control study of 21 epilepsy patients and 17 healthy controls ( ), the distribution of the perivascular space was significantly more asymmetric in epilepsy patients, and the region of maximum asymmetry was within the suspected seizure onset zone in 72% of cases. Similar results were reported in a vessel density study using SWI ( ) where vessel density was highly symmetric in the hippocampus in controls, whereas the mean vessel density asymmetry was greater in neocortical and MTL epilepsy patients, where the decrease in vessel density was ipsilateral to the suspected seizure onset zone. \n\nThe N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/ Creatinine (Cr) ratio ( ) and glutamate ( ) on MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) are potential biomarkers in epilepsy. Using voxels exhibiting a decreased NAA/Cr ratio, neocortical abnormalities were detected and localized surgery was possible ( ): in a study of 25 patients, the positive predictive value for the concordance of MRSI with a good outcome was 100%, the negative predictive value was 73%, with a sensitivity of 82%, and a specificity of 100%. In another study using single-voxel MR spectroscopy ( ), 7 out of 8 patients had altered metabolite concentrations of glutamate, glutamine, myo-inositol, NNN, Cr, and choline, as well as markedly reduced glutamine levels of 62.5% compared with that of healthy controls. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur findings support the use of 7T MRI in patients with epilepsy to identify morphologic abnormalities and define subregions of anatomic structures for surgical guidance by providing a higher signal-to-noise ratio, improved image uniformity, and better spatial resolution. Structural lesions should be identified on MRI for the presurgical workup, and the epileptogenic focus should be localized for good surgical outcomes ( ,  ,  ). Moreover, the potentially epileptogenic focus should be depicted to obtain target areas for subsequent electrode implantation or eliminate the need for intracranial EEG monitoring ( ), thereby facilitating surgery. In patients with epilepsy, 7T MRI detected or better characterized lesions and was a more focused and less invasive approach. \n\nLesions of an unknown etiology are better delineated on 7T MRI. The internal structure and extent of lesions are best visible on T2- and T2 -weighted sequences in patients with FCD and hippocampal sclerosis. Particularly, the flag-like three-layer appearance with the middle hypointense line on T2-weighted images ( ) in patients with FCD facilitates the visual diagnosis ( ,  ). In a study involving patients with polymicrogyria, 7T MRI revealed more extensive areas and occasionally detected bilateral disease involvement ( ) in patients previously assessed to have unilateral disease involvement. Moreover, high magnetic susceptibility properties improve detection of small cavernous cortical hemangioma ( ) and vascular hippocampal abnormalities with the T2 -weighted sequence ( ). \n\nThis meta-analysis provides quantitative summary estimates of the detection rates in clinical studies on epilepsy. Previous review articles reported that the detection of lesions in patients with epilepsy can be improved by ~23\u201330% ( ) on 7T, but that the results were inconsistent and had not been reviewed systemically. In this meta-analysis, the pooled detection rate of 7T MRI was higher than that of 3T MRI, with overall detection rates of 65% and 22%, respectively, showing a 33% difference. Owing to a high SNR, 7T MRI offers better spatial resolution, enabling better depiction of anatomical structures. Anatomic alterations include the transmantle sign in FCD ( ), irregular outer surface and irregular cortical-white matter junction in polymicrogyria ( ), and disruption of the internal architecture of the hippocampus in hippocampal sclerosis ( ). These findings result from a thin slice section, small voxel size, and high magnetic susceptibility of 7T MRI. \n\nRecommended specific sequences and paradigms as potential imaging biomarkers for epilepsy on 7T MRI are the improved conventional T1/T2-weighted sequence, diffusion tensor imaging, the T2 -weighted sequence/SWI, and MR spectroscopy. Diffusion tensor-based tractography provides detailed white matter architecture and better quantification of fiber density ( ,  ) and connectivity ( ). T2 -weighted and SWI sequences better demonstrate cavernomas ( ) and enlarged perivascular structures, indicating adjacent white matter disease ( ). MR spectroscopy on 7T MRI provides high spectral resolution of molecules, thereby enabling the quantification of numerous metabolites not visible on 3.0T or 1.5T MRI ( ). In addition to NAA, glutamine and glutamate ( ) are metabolites that may be used to detect neurochemical abnormalities in regions exhibiting structurally normal morphology. \n\nOur study had some limitations. First, although studies had paired data for both 3 T/1.5T and 7T MRI, comparisons of paired proportions were unavailable because articles included the detection rate but not the false-positive and false-negative, or true-negative rate in a 2 \u00d7 2 table to compare the statistical significance. Second, most of studies included a small number of patients (case study/case series) and showed heterogeneity with a low level of evidence. A prospective cohort study, with available surgical outcomes and diagnostic performance is warranted to achieve a higher level of evidence. As for the future perspective, a meta-analysis of more formalized clinical trials and larger studies would provide the clinical context and outcomes necessary for 7T MRI to become a valid clinical tool. \n\nIn conclusion, 7T MRI has value in delineating morphologic abnormalities with higher detection rate compared with clinical MRI. Most studies were conducted as case series or case studies, and a cohort study design with clinical outcomes is necessary. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nJP and E-NC contributed to the conception of the study, analysis, and manuscript preparation.

In particular, their application has been drawing more attention in the field of psychiatry, for instance, as diagnostic tests/tools for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, given their complexity and potential clinical implications, there is an ongoing need for further research on their accuracy. \n\n\n## Objective \n  \nThis study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the available evidence for the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in diagnosing ASD. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe following databases were searched on November 28, 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete (with Open Dissertations), PsycINFO, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore Digital Library. Studies that used a machine learning algorithm partially or fully for distinguishing individuals with ASD from control subjects and provided accuracy measures were included in our analysis. The bivariate random effects model was applied to the pooled data in a meta-analysis. A subgroup analysis was used to investigate and resolve the source of heterogeneity between studies. True-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative values from individual studies were used to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity values, draw Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics curves, and obtain the area under the curve (AUC) and partial AUC (pAUC). \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 43 studies were included for the final analysis, of which a meta-analysis was performed on 40 studies (53 samples with 12,128 participants). A structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) subgroup meta-analysis (12 samples with 1776 participants) showed a sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.89), a specificity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.74-0.91), and AUC/pAUC of 0.90/0.83. A functional magnetic resonance imaging/deep neural network subgroup meta-analysis (5 samples with 1345 participants) showed a sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI 0.62-0.75), specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.61-0.70), and AUC/pAUC of 0.71/0.67. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe accuracy of machine learning algorithms for diagnosis of ASD was considered acceptable by few accuracy measures only in cases of sMRI use; however, given the many limitations indicated in our study, further well-designed studies are warranted to extend the potential use of machine learning algorithms to clinical settings. \n\n\n## Trial Registration \n  \nPROSPERO CRD42018117779; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=117779 \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \n### Background \n  \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD), behaviorally characterized by a deficit in social communication and rigidity in interest or behavior by both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases-11 (ICD-11), is believed to be a product of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors [ - ]. The latest prevalence of ASD has been reported to be 1 in 59 children aged 8 years, based on the 2014 Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance data [ ], and 1 in 40 children aged 3-17 years, based on parental reports of the diagnosis in a national survey [ ]. Despite the advancement of many biomarkers with potential in prediction or early detection of ASD (eg, structural magnetic resonance imaging [sMRI] or functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]), a diagnosis is not made until the age of 4-5 years, on average [ , ]. \n\nMachine learning has been increasingly studied as a novel tool to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis and early detection of ASD [ ]. Unlike traditional rule-based algorithms that allowed computers to generate answers with preprogramed rules, machine learning allows building of an algorithm that can learn, predict, and improve with experience, based on big data [ , - ]. Psychiatric decision making is more sophisticated and difficult to characterize, compared with machine learning, although there are some common elements. Psychiatrists diagnose patients by observing their behaviors and registering all collected and collateral data into their (psychiatrists\u2019) cognitive system as sensory input values (eg, voice and vision). Similarly, machine learning requires a series of steps, including preprocessing (eg, noise removal from data before input into an algorithm), segmentation, and feature extraction [ ]. In particular, machine learning in the field of ASD diagnostics incorporates big data (eg, neuroimaging), making the input data immense and complex [ ]. The application of machine learning algorithms in the field of neuroimaging often requires an extra process, such as   feature selection   that extracts key features from a complex dataset. In other words, key features are selected before the learning process, which is called   feature selection   [ ]. \n\n\n### Objective \n  \nCurrently, machine learning is widely applied to the field of bioinformatics, including genetics and imaging, and many applications require signal recognition and processing [ ]. Machine learning algorithms are currently applied to the field of psychiatry in areas such as genomics, electroencephalogram (EEG), and neuroimaging. However, owing to the complex workflows implicated in machine learning itself, the accuracy of such algorithms is varied [ ]. This study aimed to suggest an integrated estimate of the accuracy for use of machine learning algorithms in distinguishing individuals with ASD from control groups through systematic review and meta-analysis of the available studies. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Systematic Review \n  \nThis systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Diagnostic test accuracy [ ]. The study protocol was written before initiation of the study and registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (trial registration: CRD42018117779). \n\n\n### Data Sources and Search Strategy \n  \nMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete (with Open Dissertations), and PsycINFO were selected as core search databases, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore Digital Library was added to maximize the sensitivity of the search. The IEEE Xplore Digital Library is a database created by the IEEE, the largest of its kind worldwide, and includes more than 1800 peer-reviewed conference proceedings. Default search filters provided by journals were not used. There was no restriction by publication type (eg, conference proceedings) or language. The initial search was conducted on November 28, 2018. The search strategy and query per search database are listed in  . The primary consideration for study inclusion was if machine learning was partially or fully applied in distinguishing individuals clinically diagnosed with ASD from controls and assess the accuracy of such applications.   lists inclusion/exclusion criteria. An author (SM) retrieved the initial search results and removed duplicates by using the command   find duplicate   via a reference software (Endnote X9, Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Subsequently, another author (JK) manually searched for and removed any residual duplicates. Finally, the studies were screened independently by two authors (SM and JK) by title, abstract, and keywords, after which the full texts of the selected studies were screened by two authors (SM and JK) by inclusion/exclusion criteria. If any discrepancy was found in the final selection, the two authors reached a consensus via discussion. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nA data extraction form was created through discussion among the authors before the extraction process to suggest specific subgroups and coding processes (categorizing) for a meta-analysis ( ). The process is provided in detail in  . General characteristics such as author, publication year, sample size, average age, gender ratio, and data characteristics were extracted from individual studies. Information regarding the reference standard used in individual studies and definitions of positive/negative disease (autism positive/control) and methodologies to distinguish individuals with autism from control group were collected. Specific methodologies used to process and classify data for use in machine learning algorithms were also recorded (  and  ). All accuracy values were extracted, and true-positive / true-negative / false-positive / false-negative (TP/TN/FP/FN) values were calculated from individual studies for a meta-analysis. If the TP/TN/FP/FN values could not be calculated from the accuracy values provided in a study, an email was sent to the corresponding author to request raw data. If there was no response within 14 days, the study was not included in the meta-analysis. The extraction was performed independently by two authors (SM and JK). If there was any discrepancy in the extracted data, a consensus was reached by thorough discussion after repeating the same extraction process. \n\n\n### Quality Assessment \n  \nTwo authors (SM and JK) independently assessed the quality of individual studies based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). QUADAS-2 is a validated tool used to evaluate the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies by patient selection, index test, reference standard, and risk of bias (RoB) for internal validity and external validity for applicability concerns of individual studies [ ]. There was no disagreement between authors in the assessment of patient selection and reference standard domain. The index test, also known as the target tool of our investigation in this study, is a machine learning algorithm. The target tool, the machine learning algorithm\u2019s accuracy, is reported through a process called validation. However, when a study provided no information about the validation process, low RoB was assumed if independent datasets were used for training, building a model, and validation [ ]. Otherwise, the level of RoB was determined by thoroughly reviewing the validation processes. \n\n\n### Evidence Synthesis \n  \nIn our meta-analysis, a bivariate random effects model was used to consider both within- and between-subject variability and threshold effect [ ]. A Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics (SROC) curve was generated based on parameter estimates extracted from the bivariate random effects model [ ]. The SROC curve was specified by pooled sensitivity, specificity point, 95% CIs, and prediction region. Area under the curve (AUC) and partial AUC (pAUC) were calculated based on the SROC curve [ ]. Studies that were visually deviant from the 95% prediction region on the SROC curve were considered heterogeneous [ ]. Attempts were made to resolve the heterogeneity by performing a subgroup analysis\u2014generating individual SROC curves for subgroups (minimum 5 studies) [ ]. If most studies were within the 95% prediction region on the SROC curves of the subgroups, the sample was determined to be homogeneous, and integrated sensitivity, specificity, and SROC curve results were provided. If any of the TP/FP/TN/FN value was 0, 0.5 was added to prevent zero cell count problem [ ]. The TP/FP/TN/FN values were extracted or calculated from each independent sample in a study, and if multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to the same sample, an algorithm with the best accuracy (calculated as [TP+TN]/[TP+FP+TN+FN]) was selected for data extraction. \n\nA meta-analysis was conducted via the mada package in R (version 3.4.3, R Core Team, Vienna, Austria), and statistical significance was expressed with 95% CIs. Publication bias was not assessed in our analysis, as there are currently no statistically adequate models in the field of meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy [ ]. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search, Selection, and General Characteristics \n  \nAfter duplicate removal, of the 280 studies extracted from five databases and one additional database, 43 studies were selected, of which 40 studies were included in the meta-analysis.   provides details according to the screening stage. \n\nThe publication years ranged from 2007 to 2018 for the final selection of 43 studies, of which 40 were journal articles and 3 were gray literature elements (eg, conference proceedings). A total of 10 studies used a public database that was available on the internet and open to anyone, 18 used a private sector database (eg, clinic and hospital), 3 used both public and private databases, and the remaining 12 used databases from others. Regarding the average age of the sample, 5 studies included adults, 22 studies included school-aged participants, 11 included preschool-aged participants, and the remaining 5 did not provide any information. For the machine learning algorithm, 20 studies used a support vector machine (SVM), 3 used a deep neural network (DNN), 13 used others, and the remaining 10 used and compared multiple algorithms. For prediction, 11 studies used sMRI features, 9 used fMRI features, 9 used behavior traits, 5 used biochemical features, 4 used EEG features, and the remaining 2 used text or voice features. For reference standards, 24 studies used DSM-IV, DSM-IV - Text Revision, or DSM-5; 10 used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI); 2 used ICD; and the remaining 7 did not provide relevant information. For the validation methodology, 37 studies only used internal validation, 2 only used external validation, and 4 used both. The abovementioned information is summarized in  , and the extracted raw data are presented in   and  . \n  \nFlowchart for the literature screening and selection process. \n    \nCharacteristics of 43 studies for the systematic review and 53 samples for the meta-analysis. \n    \n\n### Qualitative Assessment \n  \nOf the 43 studies in total, more than half were assessed to have an unclear RoB by patient selection domain (33 studies) and index test domain (29 studies). More than half were considered to have a low RoB by the total reference standard (35 studies) and flow and timing domains (35 studies). For applicability concern, about half (22 studies) were shown to have unclear or high-risk RoB by patient selection domain, whereas most were considered to have a low risk by index test (42 studies) and reference standard domain (36 studies). Qualitative assessment for all the individual studies is summarized in  , and the distribution is shown in  . \n  \nRisk of bias and applicability concern by domain in Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Microsoft Excel was used. \n  \n\n### Quantitative Analysis (Meta-Analysis) \n  \nOf the final selection of 43 studies, only 40, from which TP/FP/FN/TN values were extractable, were considered for the meta-analysis. A total of 53 independent samples were extracted from the 40 studies and included in the meta-analysis ( ). Of the 53 samples, 12,128 participants were inspected in the meta-analysis, with the total sensitivity and specificity ranging from 0.55 to 1.00 and 0.56 to 0.99, respectively. TP/FP/FN/TN, sensitivity, and specificity values for 53 individual samples are summarized in  , and visual distribution is provided as SROC in  . Of the 53 samples, 12 were found outside the 95% predictive region of the SROC curve, and therefore, there was heterogeneity between samples ( ). \n\nIn an attempt to resolve this heterogeneity, a subgroup analysis was conducted with 19 variables that had been predefined and coded. For replicability, a raw data sheet listing the precodified variables is available in  . As a result, among 19 variables,   predictor   was the only one by which the heterogeneity could be partially resolved. Of the 53 samples, for the sMRI subgroup that used sMRI as predictors, all the 12 samples were found to be within the predictive region of the SROC curve, thus resolving the heterogeneity ( ). \n\nFor the sMRI subgroup, the pooled sensitivity was 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.89), specificity was 0.84 (95% CI 0.74-0.91), and AUC/pAUC was 0.90/0.83. Meta-analysis was also attempted for the remaining subgroups, such as fMRI (15 samples), behavior traits (14 samples), and biochemical features (7 samples) subgroups, but the pooled sensitivity and specificity could not be provided owing to a significant degree of heterogeneity between samples: A few samples were shown to be far off the predictive region of the SROC curves ( - ). However, sub-subgroup meta-analysis using 5 samples that used fMRI as a predictor and DNN as a classifier allowed for the heterogeneity to be resolved and provided the pooled sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI 0.62-0.75), specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.61-0.70), and AUC/pAUC of 0.71/0.67 ( ). \n\nSimilarly, another sub-subgroup meta-analysis of six samples that used sMRI as a predictor and SVM as a classifier resolved the heterogeneity and resulted in a pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI 0.78-0.93), specificity of 0.87 (95% CI 0.71-0.95), and AUC/pAUC of 0.92/0.88 ( ).

On the basis of the opinion that the AUC/pAUC value is considered acceptable when above 0.7, both the AUC/pAUC values can be thought to be acceptable for the sMRI subgroup [ ]. However, given the wide confidence interval for each summary sensitivity and specificity, the clinical usefulness of those values can be difficult to determine. In addition, precaution is warranted for interpreting the accuracy results, as the 95% predictive region is larger than the 95% CI region on the SROC curve, indicating a high degree of uncertainty for the pooled sensitivity and specificity calculated [ ]. In addition, only one sample from the sMRI subgroup utilized an external validation method, where demographic characteristics of the training dataset were independent of those of the validation dataset. In other words, the rest of the samples in the sMRI subgroup built their validation datasets from participants who were similar to or the same as those recruited in the training datasets. Hence, those samples are believed to have high risks of overfitting, compromising the generalizability of machine learning models and overestimating the results of the meta-analysis of the sMRI subgroup [ ]. \n\nMachine learning algorithms can be divided into supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning by learning pattern [ ]. SVM, for which subgroup analysis was performed for sMRI, is the oldest method of supervised learning, whereas DNN, for which subgroup analysis was conducted for fMRI, is the most advanced of the neural network methods (supervised learning), modeled after the mechanism of neurons [ ]. On the contrary, the accuracy values for the fMRI subgroup using one of the latest machine learning algorithms, DNN, were found to be lower than those for the sMRI subgroup. This may, in part, be attributable to possible overestimation secondary to the overfitting in the sMRI subgroup. In addition, one of the studies in the fMRI/DNN sub-subgroup composed their dataset by recruiting over 1000 participants from various sites to minimize limitations such as overfitting in their analysis. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nOur study has several limitations. Of the final selection of 43 studies, 33 did not provide clear information regarding the process of obtaining an original database or a recruiting training/validation dataset from the real clinical world, or raw data such as basic demographic characteristics of the participants before the input process, thus increasing the RoB in the patient selection processes. For example, more than half the finally selected studies did not match the samples for age or gender, and the number of images or signals per participant was not specified in most of the neuroimaging and EEG studies. Subgroups other than the sMRI subgroup included studies that used the same database, thus raising concerns for possible sample overlap, which was challenging to process statistically owing to the lack or absence of information on the patient selection process. If datasets overlapped and lowered the accuracy, the subgroup meta-analysis would have been underestimated and vice versa. In addition, behavior, EEG, and voice/text subgroups did not consist of enough studies to attempt to resolve the heterogeneity and provide pooled accuracy values. Furthermore, owing to the heterogeneity, summary accuracy values could not be obtained for adult (aged over 18 years), school-age (between 6 and 18 years), and preschool-age (less than 6 years) subgroups, thus limiting the ability to draw a conclusion on accuracy by age groups. Corresponding authors for individual studies with small and high T  P   values (ie, 100% accurate machine learning test) were reached out to, and one responded. Even if more had responded, to our knowledge, there would not have been any way to perform the aggregation. \n\n\n### Comparison With Prior Work \n  \nTo our knowledge, there is currently no study that has performed a systematic review and/or a meta-analysis on diagnostic test accuracy for the use of machine learning in diagnosing ASD and suggested its pooled estimate accuracies. In this analysis, many individual studies reported small TP and high TP (ie, 100% accurate machine learning test) and caused significant heterogeneity for a meta-analysis (see  ). Authors resolved the heterogeneity by using subgroup analyses. As a result, individual studies with small and high T  P   values (ie, 100% accurate machine learning test) were barely included in fMRI and sMRI subgroup analyses, thereby resolving the heterogeneity and allowing conduct of the meta-analysis. Nevertheless, recommendations from our results may improve the quality of prospective studies using machine learning algorithms in ASD diagnosis. First, Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) can guide machine learning diagnostic studies to enhance the reporting of patient selection processes. In addition, there is the comprehensive guideline for algorithm developers in terms of choosing an adequate predictive model for a target sample; setting the parameters, definition, or threshold; and minimizing errors such as overfitting and perfect separation [ ]. Use of the STARD and other guidelines [ ] would facilitate more transparent and comprehensive work in this space. Although not discussed in the studies included in our analysis, decision or running time for a machine learning algorithm in ASD diagnosis could become an important quality measure in the near future when these algorithms might be employed in a busy daily clinical practice. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nThe accuracy of diagnosing ASD by machine learning algorithms was found to be acceptable by select accuracy measures only in studies that utilized sMRI. However, because of the high heterogeneity in the analyzed studies, it is impossible to draw a conclusion on any subgroups that used behavior traits or biochemical markers as predictors. There is a clear need for new studies with more comprehensive reporting of the selection process and dataset to draw a more accurate conclusion. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6942187, "text_md5": "fda99d2765b2abdb90ee68cf5070b1ac", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 84], "journal": [85, 101], "publication_year": [103, 107], "title": [118, 284], "keywords": [298, 400], "abstract": [413, 3040], "body": [3049, 25999]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31562756, "doi": "10.2196/14108", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6942187", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6942187"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6942187\">6942187</a>", "list_title": "PMC6942187  Accuracy of Machine Learning Algorithms for the Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies"}

Preclinical studies have reported that CD133 is implicated in tumor recurrence and cancer therapy resistance in high-grade gliomas; however, clinical studies have reported inconclusive results regarding its prognostic value in patients with high-grade gliomas. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe systematically searched the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to obtain peer-reviewed studies published before March 10, 2021. Then, we conducted the current systematic review and meta-analysis based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statements. By applying the random-effect model, the effect size of studies investigating the progression-free survival (PFS), time to local recurrence (TTL), and time to distant recurrence (TTD) were calculated using RevMan version 5.4. The heterogeneity between the included studies was studied by the I  index and Cochran\u2019s Q test. Egger test was performed on funnel plots to investigate the potential asymmetry and publication bias among the included studies using CMA version 2. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWith the 10% cut-off, CD133 protein overexpression is associated with the inferior PFS of patients with high-grade gliomas. Increased CD133 protein expression is associated with sooner distant tumor recurrence on MRI in glioblastoma patients and patients with high-grade gliomas and improved TTL on MRI in glioblastoma patients. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nBased on the current evidence from 1086 patients with high-grade gliomas, CD133 overexpression is a valuable marker to predict tumor relapse and tumor recurrence patterns in patients with high-grade gliomas. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nGliomas are among the frequently diagnosed primary brain tumors; however, the prognosis of affected patients is not favorable. Indeed, tumor recurrence and cancer therapy resistance have posed daunting challenges for patients with high-grade gliomas ( ). Therefore, a better understanding of the biology of high-grade gliomas might pave the way for introducing novel biomarkers that can predict the prognosis of affected patients. \n\nCancer stem cells are a small population of tumor bulk that has been introduced as the main culprit of tumor relapse. The stemness and self-renewal features of these tumoral cells can give rise to a malignant tumor after the initial therapy. Besides tumor development, cancer stem cells can facilitate tumor migration ( \u2013 ). These tumor-initiating cells have also been implicated in chemoresistance. Indeed, the overexpression of aldehyde dehydrogenase-I, stimulated DNA repair mechanisms, reduced chemotherapeutic agents influx, and increased their efflux are among the proposed mechanisms for cancer stem cells-mediated chemoresistance in high-grade gliomas ( ). It has been reported that these cells can stimulate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, leading to stemness, increased invasion, and proliferation in high-grade gliomas ( ,  ). Wickstr\u00f6m et\u00a0al. have indicated that the stimulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is highly associated with temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma   via   activating MGMT ( ). \n\nPreclinical findings have indicated that CD133 is overexpressed in cancer stem cells of high-grade gliomas. It has been shown that CD133 can activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, maintaining the cancer stem cell population in glioblastoma. Indeed, the expression level of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-related signals in CD133-positive cancer stem cells has been substantially increased compared to differentiated CD133-negative glioblastoma cells ( ). Growing evidence indicates that CD133 can increase proliferation, induce cancer therapy resistance, and maintain stemness in glioblastoma ( \u2013 ). Despite the critical roles of CD133 in tumor development, there is a controversy about the prognostic value of CD133 in predicting tumor relapse and its recurrence pattern in high-grade gliomas ( \u2013 ). \n\nHerein, the current study aims to determine the prognostic value of CD133 in predicting tumor relapse and tumor recurrence patterns in patients with high-grade gliomas. The results of this current study can be translated into clinical practice to predict tumor recurrence and its patterns in patients with high-grade gliomas. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThis study was performed according to the PRISMA statements ( ). \n\n### Search Strategy \n  \nThe PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases were systematically searched to obtain peer-reviewed records published before March 10, 2021, with the following keywords: (\u201cCD133\u201d OR \u201cprominin-1\u201d OR \u201cAC133\u201d OR \u201cAC133 antigen\u201d OR \u201cPROML1\u201d OR \u201cAC133 antigen\u201d OR \u201cprominin-like protein 1\u201d OR \u201cCORD12\u201d OR \u201cRP41\u201d OR \u201cMSTP061\u201d OR \u201cMCDR2\u201d OR \u201cSTGD4\u201d OR \u201cprominin 1\u201d OR \u201cprominin (mouse)-like 1\u201d OR \u201cHProminin\u201d OR \u201cPROM1\u201d OR \u201cantigen AC133\u201d OR \u201cCD133 antigen\u201d) and (\u201cglioblastoma\u201d OR \u201cglioblastoma multiforme\u201d OR \u201chigh-grade glioma\u201d OR \u201chigh grade glioma\u201d OR \u201canaplastic\u201d OR \u201canaplastic astrocytoma\u201d OR \u201castrocytoma\u201d OR \u201cgrade III glioma\u201d OR \u201cgrade IV glioma\u201d) and (\u201clocal recurrence\u201d OR \u201cdistant recurrence\u201d OR \u201clocal relapse\u201d OR \u201cdistant relapse\u201d OR \u201clocal recurrent\u201d OR \u201cdistant recurrent\u201d OR \u201clocal-recurrence\u201d OR \u201cdistant-recurrence\u201d OR \u201clocal-relapse\u201d OR \u201cdistant-relapse\u201d OR \u201clocal-recurrent\u201d OR \u201cdistant-recurrent\u201d OR \u201cLRFS\u201d OR \u201clocal recurrence-free survival\u201d OR \u201cdistant recurrence-free survival\u201d OR \u201cDRFS\u201d OR \u201clocal recurrence free survival\u201d OR \u201cdistant recurrence free survival\u201d OR \u201clocal-recurrence-free survival\u201d OR \u201cdistant-recurrence-free survival\u201d OR \u201cDRFS\u201d OR \u201clocal-recurrence free survival\u201d OR \u201cdistant-recurrence free survival\u201d OR \u201crelapse-free survival\u201d OR \u201crecurrence-free survival\u201d OR \u201crelapse free survival\u201d OR \u201crecurrence free survival\u201d OR \u201cRFS\u201d OR \u201clocal relapse-free survival\u201d OR \u201clocal relapse free survival\u201d OR \u201clocal-relapse-free survival\u201d OR \u201clocal-relapse free survival\u201d OR \u201cdistant relapse free survival\u201d OR \u201cdistant relapse-free survival\u201d OR \u201cdistant-relapse-free survival\u201d OR \u201cdistant-relapse free survival\u201d OR \u201ctime to progression\u201d OR \u201ctime-to-progression\u201d OR \u201ctime to-progression\u201d OR \u201ctime-to progression\u201d OR \u201cTTP\u201d OR \u201cprogression-free survival\u201d OR \u201cPFS\u201d OR \u201cprogression free survival\u201d OR \u201cdisease free survival\u201d OR \u201cdisease-free survival\u201d OR \u201cDFS\u201d OR \u201cdistant recurrence-free interval\u201d OR \u201cdistant recurrence free interval\u201d OR \u201cdistant-recurrence free interval\u201d OR \u201cdistant-recurrence-free interval\u201d OR \u201crecurrence-free interval\u201d OR \u201crecurrence free interval\u201d OR \u201cDDFS\u201d OR \u201cdistant disease-free survival\u201d OR \u201cdistant disease free survival\u201d OR \u201cdistant-disease free survival\u201d OR \u201cdistant-disease-free survival\u201d OR \u201cIDFS\u201d OR \u201cinvasive disease-free survival\u201d OR \u201cinvasive disease free survival\u201d OR \u201cinvasive-disease free survival\u201d OR \u201cinvasive-disease-free survival\u201d OR \u201cprognosis\u201d OR \u201cprognostic\u201d OR \u201cprognoses\u201d). We incorporated the Emtree and MeSH terms to increase the sensitivity of our systematic search. \n\n\n### Definition of Recurrence Pattern Indices \n  \nTo investigate the prognostic value of CD133 expression in determining relapse and recurrence patterns of high-grade gliomas, we investigated the association between the protein expression of CD133 with TTL, TTD, and PFS. Local recurrence is defined as a new enhanced lesion on MRI contiguous (< 3cm) the resection site, and distant recurrence is defined as a new enhanced lesion on MRI away (> 3cm) from the resection site ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Study Selection and Data Extraction \n  \nAfter the systematic search, the retrieved studies were screened in two phases. In the first phase, the obtained papers were independently reviewed by two authors (M.A.S and N.H) based on their titles and abstracts. In the second phase, the full text of the records and their supplementary data were independently reviewed by the same authors for consideration to be included in the current meta-analysis. Any disagreements were resolved   via   consulting with B.B and consensus. \n\n\n### The Inclusion and the Exclusion Criteria \n  \nStudies with the following eligibility criteria were included in the current meta-analysis: (1) clinical studies, (2) investigations with the objectives of studying the association between CD133 expression with the relapse and the recurrence pattern-related survival indices, i.e., TTL, TTD, and PFS, in patients with high-grade gliomas, (3) studies that investigated the protein expression of CD133 in high-grade gliomas, and (4) studies that were published in English. \n\nRecords with the following criteria were excluded from the meta-analysis: (1) studies that failed to fulfill the inclusion criteria as mentioned above, (2) studies that only investigated the mRNA expression of CD133, rather than protein expression of CD133, (3) investigations that did not provide the prognostic data regarding the CD133 expression, (4) meeting abstracts, (5) duplicated records, (6) book chapters, (7) preclinical studies, (8) review articles, and (9) studies that were solely based on bioinformatics. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nThe following data were extracted from the included studies: (1) the first author and the year of publication, (2) the sample size, (3) the country, (4) the glioma grade, (5) the measured end-point, (6) the detection method, (7) cut-off for considering CD133 expression as high, and (8) the HR and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of measured PFS, TTD, and TTL. \n\n\n### Evaluating the Quality of Included Studies \n  \nWe assessed the quality of the included studies to facilitate the translation of our obtained results into routine practice. The quality of included studies has been evaluated according to the Hayden et\u00a0al. checklist ( ). \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nWe used RevMan version 5.4 to conduct our meta-analyses. The common effect sizes were calculated as HR to assess the association between the protein expression of CD133 with the relapse and the recurrence pattern of high-grade gliomas in affected patients. Since there might be unpublished investigations regarding this topic, we applied the random-effect model. Like our previous investigation, the standard chi-squared test (Cochran Q test) and I  index were used to assess the possible heterogeneity among the included studies ( ). The values over 50% for the I  index were considered as high heterogeneity. To visualize the potential asymmetry and publication bias, we provided funnel plots using CMA version 2. Besides, we performed the Egger test to evaluate the potential publication bias in an objective manner. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### The Results of the Systematic Review \n  \nWe obtained 992 records from PubMed (  n  =179), and Web of Science (  n  =201), Embase (  n  =286), and Scopus (  n  =326). After removing duplicated studies, the title and the abstracts of the remaining studies were screened. In the second phase, the full text of the remaining 36 studies and their supplementary data were reviewed for consideration to be included in the current meta-analysis. Following the exclusion of the 24 studies, we extracted the data from the remaining 12 studies. The flowchart of our systematic review process is demonstrated in  . The characteristics of the included studies are shown in  . \n  \nThe flowchart of literature identification, inclusion, and exclusion in the current systematic review. \n    \nThe characteristics of the twelve included studies. \n    \nThe included studies have been published between 2008 to 2020. The included studies concerning the PFS of affected patients have applied different cut-offs for considering protein CD133 expression as high. However, the studies investigating CD133 protein expression with TTL and TTD have applied a unified method and cut-off ( ). \n\n\n### The Protein Expression of CD133 and PFS of Patients With High-Grade Gliomas \n  \nOur results have indicated that increased protein expression of CD133 is significantly associated with the inferior PFS of patients with high-grade gliomas (HR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.22 \u2013 2.42, P = 0.002). Our results have also indicated a high and significant heterogeneity between the included studies (I  = 65%, P = 0.003) ( ).

Besides, we have found no significant heterogeneity between the included studies (I  = 45%, P = 0.16) ( ). \n  \nThe forest plot of studies evaluating the prognostic value of CD133 in determining the TTL of patients with high-grade gliomas. \n  \n\n### The Evaluation of Potential Bias in the Included Studies \n  \nWe assessed the quality of included studies based on the Hayden et\u00a0al. statements. Three studies have shown bias in the confounding measurement and account; however, collectively, there has been no considerable bias that can affect the obtained results ( ). \n  \nThe quality assessment of included studies based on the Hayden et\u00a0al. checklists. \n    \n\n### Evaluating Potential Publication Bias \n  \nBased on our results, there has been no significant publication bias in our obtained results regarding the prognostic value of CD133 overexpression in patients with high-grade gliomas, the prognostic value of CD133 overexpression in patients with high-grade gliomas with 2% cut-off, the prognostic value of CD133 overexpression in patients with high-grade gliomas with 10% cut-off, and the TTD of patients with high-grade gliomas ( ). However, our results have demonstrated significant publication bias in the studies evaluating the TTL of patients with high-grade gliomas ( ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nAlthough multiple clinical studies have investigated the prognostic value of CD133 in predictive tumor relapse and recurrence patterns in patients with high-grade gliomas, the published results are inconclusive. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify its prognostic value in predicting tumor relapse and recurrence patterns in patients with high-grade gliomas. \n\nAs a transmembrane glycoprotein, CD133 has been implicated in glioblastoma growth ( ). In 2004, Singh et\u00a0al. reported that only brain tumor cells with CD133-positive phenotype could initiate tumor development in mice brains ( ). Liu et\u00a0al. have indicated that CD133-positive glioblastoma cells overexpress the genes involved in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting stemness, i.e., Nestin, CD90, CD44, MGMT, CXCR4, and Musashi-1 ( ). Furthermore, CD133 can confer radioresistance to glioblastoma cells and promote radiation-induced DNA damage repair ( ). Besides radioresistance, CD133 upregulation has been associated with chemoresistance. Poon et\u00a0al. have shown that there has been a strong association between adducin 3, a cytoskeletal factor linked with chemoresistance, with CD133. Indeed, this co-expression has been highly associated with a temozolomide-resistant state in glioblastoma cells ( ). Consistent with this, Nakai et\u00a0al. have reported a remarkable association between CD133 and MDR1 in glioblastoma cells and resected glioblastoma tissues, indicating the critical role of CD133 in maintaining chemoresistance ( ). Therefore, CD133 can be considered a critical factor in chemo/radioresistance development in glioblastoma, which can reproduce glioma after initial therapy. \n\nOur results have indicated that increased protein expression of CD133 is significantly associated with the inferior PFS of patients with high-grade gliomas (HR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.22 \u2013 2.42, P = 0.002). However, the high heterogeneity between studies has urged us to conduct meta-analyses based on the cut-offs of CD133 protein expression (I  = 65%, P = 0.003) ( ). Our results have demonstrated that with the threshold of 10%, CD133 protein overexpression is significantly associated with the inferior PFS of affected patients (HR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.10 \u2013 3.01, P = 0.02). Consistent with our observed results, Wang et\u00a0al. have also indicated that protein/gene overexpression of CD133 is associated with the inferior PFS of patients with low-grade patients ( ). Although it has been previously shown that CD133 overexpression is associated with worsened PFS of glioma patients, those results are based on pooling the protein and gene expression of CD133, which can be misleading ( ). Besides, pooling data from low-grade gliomas and high-grade gliomas can also lead to misleading results ( ). Moreover, without defining the cut-off for considering CD133 expression as overexpressed, the clinical translation of these kinds of studies might be at stake. In contrast, with including recently published studies and analyzing the protein expression of CD133 based on glioma grades and their defined cut-offs, the current updated study indicates that CD133 overexpression with 10% cut-off is associated with the inferior PFS in patients with high-grade gliomas. \n\nFor the first time, our meta-analysis has shown that increased protein expression of CD133 is associated with the inferior TTD of patients with glioblastoma and high-grade glioma patients (HR = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.81 \u2013 6.07, P = 0.0001, and HR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.18 \u2013 2.29, P = 0.003, respectively). Indeed, our results have indicated that upregulated protein expression of CD133 is associated with sooner distant tumor relapse in glioblastoma and high-grade glioma patients. Besides, our results have demonstrated that increased protein expression of CD133 is associated with the improved TTL of glioblastoma patients (HR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.33 \u2013 0.68, P < 0.0001). Although our study has also indicated that elevated protein expression of CD133 is associated with favorable TTL of patients with high-grade gliomas (HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.35 \u2013 0.94, P = 0.03), there has been significant publication bias among the included studies ( ). Thus, further investigations are required for evaluating the association between increased CD133 protein expression with the TTL of these patients. Collectively, our results have indicated that increased protein expression of CD133 is associated with sooner distant recurrence of glioblastoma and high-grade gliomas on MRI. Also, increased protein expression of CD133 is associated with improved TTL of glioblastomas on MRI. Therefore, the protein expression of CD133 can be a valuable prognostic factor for predicting the recurrence patterns of glioblastoma and high-grade gliomas in affected patients. \n\nThe current study has several limitations. First, we only included the studies that were published in English. Its second limitation stems from the nature of cohort studies that, unlike randomized clinical trials, all the confounding variables cannot be addressed. Nevertheless, the current study has several strengths as well. First, for the first time, our study has sorted out the prognostic value of protein expression of CD133, as the functional form of CD133, in predicting the relapse and recurrence pattern of high-grade gliomas based on defined cut-offs. Second, our study has linked a cancer stem cell marker and preclinical findings with clinical and imaging findings, which pave the way for more investigations to correlate the cancer stem markers with imaging findings. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWith a 10% cut-off, increased protein expression of CD133 is associated with the inferior PFS of patients with high-grade gliomas. Besides, the increased protein expression of CD133 is associated with sooner distant tumor recurrence and improved TTL of glioblastomas. Also, we have found that elevated protein expression of CD133 is associated with a shorter time of distant tumor recurrence in affected patients with high-grade gliomas. Overall, the protein overexpression of CD133 can be a valuable prognostic biomarker for predicting the relapse and recurrence pattern of high-grade gliomas. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ .

The ongoing systematic review will provide high-quality synthesis of current evidence of machine learning system for detecting ACL injury. \n\n\n## Registration: \n  \nThe meta-analysis has been prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019136581). \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is a common sports injury, it has a significant effect on knee function which may cause joint instability, decreased activity and poor knee-related quality of life.  There are approximately 200,000 cases per year in the United States alone.  A cohort study found an incidence of ACL tears of 3.2% for men and 3.5% for women during a 4-year period in America.  Surgery reconstruction is the predominant treatment for an ACL injury in current practice.  Direct hospital costs of ACL reconstruction surgery in 2014\u201315 were estimated to be $142 million. \n\nTimely and accurate diagnosis and treatment of ACL injury could prevent the emergence of cartilage degeneration, the progression of bone contusion, the aggravation of traumatic arthritis or the occurrence of knee joint dysfunction.  Arthroscopy is the gold standard for evaluating internal disorders and other lesions of the knee.  However, arthroscopy constitutes a relatively expensive and invasive examination which restricted its routine use in clinical practice. As a non-invasive method with good soft tissue contrast, high spatial resolution, multi-parameter and multi-range imaging for the evaluation of knee lesions, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used in the diagnosis of ACL injury with appreciable diagnostic performance when compared with arthroscopy.  But it might be sometime tiresome, time-consuming and prone to errors for radiologists to detect various injuries from magnetic resonance (MR) scans and determine the level of injury. Furthermore, making an accurate diagnosis based on MR images may still be challenging for a non-musculoskeletal radiologist, a trainee on call, or a clinician in a rural area without access to subspecialty radiology. \n\nRecently, new information and communication technologies have changed the way of operations in all fields of life such as intelligent transportation systems, agriculture, education, and healthcare systems.  Machine learning technology, categorized into supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning, semi-supervised machine learning and reinforcement machine learning which can automatically or semi-automatically predict development trends and potential rules of medical data may provide a solution to traditional diagnostic defects because of its important applications for disease diagnosis and medical research.  Deep learning, a powerful emerging branch of machine learning, has yielded breakthroughs in computer vision benchmarks in recent years.  This technology underlies almost all of the most recent advances in artificial intelligence over the past several years, from self-driving cars to voice and facial recognition-tasks which promote researchers to consider its potential applications in the healthcare field.  The development of deep learning technology makes it more accurate to analysis medical datasets when compared with other machine learning technology that efforts to apply deep learning methods to health care are already planned or underway. \n\nIn the past decade, several computer-aided diagnostic systems based on machine learning including deep learning technology had been developed to detect ACL injury automatically or semi-automatically.  However, different diagnostic tests may use different algorithms of which the diagnostic results in validation sets were not always consistent. Furthermore, the limited sample size of the validation sets in original studies may cause confusing results. A high-quality meta-analysis which can pool data from individual studies and reanalyze using established statistical methods has been increasingly regarded as one of the key tools for achieving evidence.  However, there is not any meta-analysis to synthesize the existing studies on the diagnosis of ACL injury by machine learning for more reliable results. \n\nTherefore, we will conduct this diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) meta-analysis to assess the value of machine-learning-assisted diagnosis for detecting ACL injury based on MRI. \n\n\n## Method and analysis \n  \n### Patient and public involvement \n  \nThere is no patient and public involvement in the whole process when we conduct this research. \n\n\n### Registration and reporting \n  \nThe protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis had been prospectively registered at PROSPERO (CRD42019136581) for quality control when we started searching for relative studies.  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)  will be referenced throughout the study and this protocol is based on an extension of PRISMA for protocol (PRISMA-P). \n\n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \n#### Type of studies \n  \nAll primary prospective and retrospective clinical diagnostic accuracy studies exploring the diagnostic efficacy of machine-learning-assisted detection for ACL injury with quantitative data will be included. No restriction is set for specific machine learning algorithm initially. There will be no limitations on the year of publication. Only literature published in English will be considered. Furthermore, editorials, letters, and comments et al will not be considered. Relative reviews will be checked to track their references for potentially eligible studies. Studies will be excluded when there is not sufficient data or the full texts could not be obtained. \n\n\n#### Participants \n  \nOnly studies in patients with an ACL injury will be considered for inclusion for this review. There will be no restriction for other comorbidities of the knee joint. ACL injury was confirmed based on different process criteria in different research (ie, visual inspection by a board-certified subspecialist musculoskeletal radiologist,  3 musculoskeletal radiologists established reference standard labels based on an internal validation set of 120 exams ). Different diagnostic criteria of included studies will all be extracted for later analysis. The knee joint MR images of all participants should be available to the machine learning system and scanned for identification and diagnosis of ACL injury in all included studies. \n\n\n#### Index test \n  \nThe machine-learning-assisted system based on different algorithms was used for detecting ACL injury through MR images in each included study. Some studies compared the diagnostic performance of different algorithms or models,  then we will consider all the diagnostic data of each algorithm instead of only the best one. As a general process of machine diagnosis system development, it needs to go through training set for model training, turning set for algorithm optimizing, validation set for verifying the diagnostic performance of the final model. We will consider the validation set for diagnostic efficacy evaluation which tends to be the final optimal data. Results from machine detection were compared with a diagnosis from experienced radiologists  or examined by medical experts  et al in primary studies. \n\n\n#### Outcomes \n  \nOnly studies reporting quantitative diagnostic results of machine-learning-assisted detection compared to the reference test such as sensitivity, specificity or the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) will be considered for inclusion. We should be able to extract or calculate the true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative of the index test, otherwise, it will be excluded. \n\n\n\n### Search strategies \n  \nWe will conduct a comprehensive computer-based literature search without year and language restrictions to identify all relevant clinical diagnostic tests which might improve the quality of retrieval.  The key text words of our search strategies are \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, \u201cmachine learning\u201d, \u201cdeep learning\u201d, and \u201canterior cruciate ligament\u201d. The following electronic databases will be searched: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The format and combination of search terms are adjusted to fit each electronic database. Searching strategies in different databases are presented in supplemental content. Additionally, we will manually retrieve congress reports and conference proceedings. References of included study will also be traced back to find potential qualified studies. Grey literature will be identified through Google Scholar. \n\n\n### Study selections \n  \nLiterature records will be imported into ENDNOTE X7 software for management after literature retrieval. We will exclude duplicates at first, and then 2 reviewers will independently screen the titles and abstracts of all the remaining records for later full-text selection of potentially eligible studies. Final inclusion will be made after checking all the full texts from the previous step while excluded studies and the reasons for their exclusion will be recorded in EXCEL 2016 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA,  ). Any dispute arising in the pairing process will be resolved by consensus. We will try to contact with the main authors if the full text cannot be obtained. The selection process will be presented in a PRISMA flow diagram (see Fig.  ). \n  \nPRISMA flow diagram of studies selection process. \n  \n\n### Data extraction \n  \nTwo reviewers will independently search and extract target information in included articles based on standard data extraction form in Excel 2016 designed in advance. The standard data extraction form will contains the basic information of target studies (first author, year of publication, study design, sample size, the gender and age composition of participants, the characteristics of index test and reference test et al) and result data (sensitivity, specificity, true positive, false positive, false negative, true negative et al) of the included studies. When data extraction has been finished separately, the 2 reviewers will check together for a final version. Any disagreements will be resolved by consensus. If the data was not fully reported, we will try to contact the authors of the papers asking for the original data. Studies will be excluded if we could not have access to the necessary data. \n\n\n### Risk of bias assessment \n  \nTwo reviewers will assess the bias of included studies independently and check together by using the QUADAS-2 tool  which comprises 4 domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. Each domain can be rated as \u201cHigh risk\u201d, \u201cLow risk\u201d, or \u201cUnclear risk?\u201d to assess the risk of bias from different angles. Furthermore, the first three domains will be assessed for applicability concerns and rated using the same categories. Any disagreement will be resolved by consensus. Studies with high risk of bias will be considered for exclusion or sensitivity analysis. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis and data synthesis \n  \nWe will standardize extracted information of each included study at first. For some important general nonnumerical information, we will present it in tables and supplements and describe qualitatively. We will extract or calculate binary diagnostic accuracy data from all studies and constructed 2\u200a\u00d7\u200a2 tables for each study. Each sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence interval (CI) will be presented in forest plots and in the receiver operating characteristics space. \n\nTo generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity, we will apply bivariate meta-analysis methods.  Review Manager (RevMan; Version 5.3) and Stata SE (Version 12.0) software will be used for data synthesis. Summary measures for diagnostic accuracy of the machine-learning-assisted detection (sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratios, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio) will be calculated using a bivariate random-effects model. A hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve will also be plotted, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is going to calculated using the bivariate model. If applicable, we will conduct subgroup based on pre-set criteria to find more information: \n  \npartial injury vs complete tear; \n  \nwith knee joint comorbidity versus without knee joint comorbidity; \n  \ndifferent machine learning algorithms used in primary studies; \n  \ndifferent MRI sequences and magnet intensities used in primary studies. \n  \nIf we find that pooling of the results would be inappropriate (for instance, the heterogeneity is too great, or the number of included studies are too small), we will use a narrative approach to synthesize the data. \n\n\n### Heterogeneity investigation \n  \nCochrane   \u03c7   test and   I   will be used to quantitatively determine the heterogeneity (test level is \u03b1 = 0.05). Significant heterogeneity is defined as   P  \u200a<\u200a.05. The magnitude of heterogeneity can be categorized as low (0%\u201330%), moderate (30%\u201350%), considerable (50%\u201370%) and substantial (70%\u2013100%).  To better interpreter the source of heterogeneity, we will conduct exploratory subgroup analysis in addition to the above mentioned if applicable. If data are too heterogeneous to pooling of effect sizes in a meaningful or valid way, we will use a narrative approach to synthesize the data. \n\n\n### Reporting bias and sensitivity analysis \n  \nIf there are more than 10 studies for data synthesis, we will carry out an informal visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger test to explore the potential publication bias.  Statistical significance will be considered with respect to a p-value of <0.1 due to the low power of the test. Additionally, sensitivity analysis will be carried out by excluding each study from the overall results and then results will be compared with overall findings to evaluate the stability of the results. \n\n\n### Confidence in cumulative evidence \n  \nThe Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool (AMSTAR 2) will be used to assess the methodological quality of finished systematic review.  And the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system will be applied for quantifying absolute effects and quality of the evidence. \n\n\n### Ethics and dissemination \n  \nThere is no need for a requirement of ethical approval and informed consent for this study because it is based on published literature. And the results of this systematic review will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication and information sharing. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nComputational scientists are trying to develop different machine learning systems based on various algorithms for clinical applications. The use of machine learning in medicine promises to free doctors from repetitive labor and may be able to perform better. Additionally, the introduction of machine learning to health care might have a promoting effect on the development of health system especially in the rural and remote areas,  as well as bring to new opportunities and challenges to develop clinical guidelines.  However, there may be some obstacles to the application of machine learning algorithms in clinical practice. One of them is that models which were familiar to computational scientists with different diagnostic performance are unfamiliar to clinicians. Furthermore, there appears to be some difficulties and limitations according to our previous work that a considerable number of diagnostic tests were based on retrospective case data and may cannot accurately evaluate the clinical diagnosis effect when introduced to the clinic for instance. \n\nThis meta-analysis will systematically evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of the machine learning system for ACL injury firstly. We will get the overall sensitivity and specificity of the machine learning system and the overall sensitivity and specificity of the different algorithms. The results hope to provide a state of current research and new research direction of the interdisciplinary field of artificial intelligence and medicine for ACL injury detection as well as promotes the clinical application of machine learning systems. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis protocol paper outlined the significance and methodologically details of a systematic review of machine-learning-assisted detection for ACL injury. This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide high-quality synthesis of current evidence of machine learning system for detecting ACL injury based on MRI. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \nLiang Yao and Peijing Yan contributed to study concept and design, Yongfeng Lao and Bibo Jia wrote the first draft and other authors had gave some suggestions for modification. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6922500, "text_md5": "7ba485e4184c0964ed6e91d8d649f75a", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 161], "journal": [162, 182], "publication_year": [184, 188], "title": [199, 331], "keywords": [345, 465], "abstract": [478, 3295], "body": [3304, 19782]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31852123, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000018324", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6922500", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6922500"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6922500\">6922500</a>", "list_title": "PMC6922500  Diagnostic accuracy of machine-learning-assisted detection for anterior cruciate ligament injury based on magnetic resonance imaging"}

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING FINDINGS IN 22Q11.2 DELETION SYNDROME\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nSince the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is the most important genetic model for psychotic disorders, an increasing interest in its brain structural and functional abnormalities has arisen in the last decade. However, studies so far have reported inconsistent findings. Therefore, the aims of the present study are 1) to systematic review the literature on structural and functional brain abnormalities associated to 22q11.2 DS and 2) to identify the most consistently reported abnormalities through a meta-analysis of structural (sMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe following electronic databases were systematically searched: PubMed, ETHOS, Kings Open Portal, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINHAL. Studies were included if they presented original data, were written in English, had a sample size larger than 5, had a healthy control comparison group, and if they reported results from a whole brain analysis. As we were interested in identifying abnormalities in both brain structure and function, in the systematic review we included studies that used different imaging techniques (i.e. sMRI, fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)). The meta-analysis was performed with studies reporting results in standardised-space coordinates (e.g. Talairach), using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method. Results were corrected at cluster level with family wise error correction (p=0.01) and 1000 permutations. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nSeventy-three original articles were included in the systematic review, 25 of these were also included in the meta-analysis. Forty-two sMRI, 23 fMRI and 11 DTI articles were retrieved. Only one study performed a direct comparison between 22q11.2 DS individuals with and without psychosis. \n\nThe systematic review revealed that the most affected areas were the frontal middle gyri bilaterally, the posterior cingulum bilaterally, the right cuneus, the precuneus bilaterally, the right superior temporal gyrus, the left parietal inferior gyrus and the left side of the cerebellum. \n\nThe meta-analysis revealed consistent abnormalities in a cluster located in the inferior parietal lobe (4936 voxels, peak of activation in the coordinate -44 -52 48) and extending to the superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus and precuneus. A second cluster of consistent activation is found in the posterior cingulate cortex (3104 voxels, peak of activation in the coordinate 6 -50 16). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe systematic review revealed widespread abnormalities throughout the brain, mainly within areas involved in visual and speech processing, language, and within association areas. The meta-analysis of structural and functional studies revealed consistent abnormalities in the inferior parietal lobe, an area consistently found affected in psychosis. \n\nOnly few studies on 22q11.2 DS individuals with psychosis were available and most studies included young individuals (mean age 15.12) rather than adults. 22q11.2 DS is one of the most compelling genetic models of schizophrenia, however most imaging studies do not provide clinical data on psychotic symptoms. This could partially be explained by the relatively low mean age of the overall sample; some participants could have been too young to manifest psychotic symptoms. Finally, the present study does not allow to make inferences on brain changes overtime as longitudinal studies were scarce. \n\nFuture studies should adopt a longitudinal design and investigate brain abnormalities in adults with 22q11.2 DS displaying symptoms of psychosis. This would help to clarify the brain structural and functional features associated with this particular form of psychosis and their longitudinal course. \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 5887962, "text_md5": "b416f07e0fc4203d4e41ca7f8920dbc6", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 150], "journal": [151, 165], "publication_year": [167, 171], "title": [182, 291], "keywords": [305, 305], "abstract": [318, 4079], "body": [4088, 4088]}, "batch": 2, "doi": "10.1093/schbul/sby018.963", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5887962", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=5887962"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5887962\">5887962</a>", "list_title": "PMC5887962  S176.

These incidences carry an especially high rate of mortality, as well as the survival ratio estimated between 53% and 92%.  Despite the decline in the incidence of ischemic strokes over the past few decades, it remains the leading cause of death and disability in the western countries.  Diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remain novel clinical imaging methods; however, the application of either one of them in the diagnosis of ischemic stroke in the acute period (first or second day) only benefits a small portion of patients.  Therefore, in order to lessen the incidence of IS worldwide, understanding both stroke prevention and effectively treating those diagnosed are of optimal importance. \n\nStroke can be diagnosed through several methods, which include; neurological examination, computed tomography (CT) scans, MRI scans, Doppler ultrasound, and arteriography. A transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography (ultrasonography) is a simple, non-invasive method that is used in order to examine the intracerebral blood flow.  It is a safe and portable method which allows it to be utilized by the bedside in a short amount of time.  Although various kinds of imaging methods have made great advancements since their inception, CT remains the most common and effectively used imaging method for both the ability to diagnosis acute ischemic stroke and differentiates from hemorrhagic stroke due to its lower cost, widespread availability, rapid speed, and accuracy in comparison with other major imaging methods.  Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is used to examine blood vessels in the brain, kidneys, pelvis and the lungs.  Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) is another useful imaging method which can provide significant information about the capillary-level hemodynamics of the brain parenchyma.  MRI scans allow doctors to obtain images of diffusion and perfusion, and has been shown to be very useful in the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, while comparatively differentiating it from hemorrhagic strokes.  Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is commonly used in order to evaluate the status of both cervical and intracranial arteries as well as determine the presence of ischemic tissue at risk, which has been used in comprehensive stroke protocols.  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a technique used on the basis of MRI, which has higher sensitivity and accuracy for acute ischemia stroke which has been made clear through comparison with the other imaging methods.  DWI is sensitive to acute cellular injury in cerebral ischemia and can be used in order to assess ischemic lesions in the first few hours.  Despite the abundant amount of literature that analyze the various detection and therapeutic aspects of different imaging methods, no comprehensive literature that investigates the diagnostic values of ischemic stroke by ultrasonography, CT, and MRI through a network meta-analysis has been made available. Thus, this study aimed to compare diagnostic values among ultrasonography, CT and MRI by a network meta-analysis in the hopes of understanding which imaging method is best served to treat/diagnose acute ischemic stroke. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Ethical statement \n  \nAll 13 enrolled studies in this network meta-analysis have consented to the ethical statements provided to them in regards to the current investigation. \n\n\n### Literature search \n  \nAn electronic search of English literature databases such as Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase and China national knowledge internet (CNKI) and Wan-fang databases for articles that were published from the beginning of this investigation up until February 2019 was carried out. Literature was manually searched using different combinations of keywords and free words. The search terms included: stroke, MRI, CT, ultrasonography, DWI, and so on. \n\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nThe inclusion criteria used to find literature were: \n  \nStudy design should be diagnostic tests studies. \n  \nThe imaging methods should include 2 or more of the following imaging methods: traditional CT, CTA, CTP, DWI, MRA, MRI, and ultrasonography. \n  \nSubjects should be consecutive ischemic stroke patients aged between 18 and 100 years old. \n  \nOutcomes of the research should include parameters, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. \n  \nGold standard, namely the final imaging and clinical examination, can result in a proper diagnosis. \n  \nThe exclusion criteria were: studies with insufficient data integrity or those that were not related to ischemic stroke, repeated published literature, conference reports, systematic reviews or summary articles, non-English literature, and non-human research. \n\n\n### Data extraction and quality assessment \n  \nA standardized data extraction form was used in order to extract the relevant information required for this meta-analysis: the first author, published year, nationality, ethnicity, age, gender, the gold standard, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV, and accuracy. This was carried out by 2 investigators who independently extracted and incorporated the data into this study. Disagreements regarding the extraction of the data were resolved when the discussion among several researchers reached a consensus. The quality of the included studies made by the two researchers was assessed according to the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2).  The QUADAS-2 includes the following domains: patient selection, reference standard, index text and flow of patients through the study/timing of index tests, and relevant reference standard. A Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5.2.3, Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) was used in order to assess both the quality and investigate publication bias. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nInitially, we performed a direct comparison of the various kinds of treatment methods using a traditional pairwise meta-analysis. The results showed the pooled estimation between the odds ratio (ORs) and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) in strokes. Heterogeneity was analyzed by using a Chi-square test, with the value of   P  \u200a<.05 suggesting heterogeneity. In addition, an   I   statistic   was adopted in order to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity, with the range of   I   value between 0% and 100%. The higher the   I   value was, the more obvious the heterogeneity was among the specimen. The values of   P  \u200a<.05 or   I  \u200a>50% indicated that there was greater heterogeneity in the specimen. Based on the results, the random-effect model was used for further analysis, otherwise, a fixed-effect model was performed. Next, R 3.2.1 was used for drawing network diagrams, with each diagram node representing each intervention. The node size represented the sample size, as well as the line thickness between nodes represented the study numbers. Adding onto this, we made use of different comparisons involving interventions using a Bayesian network meta-analysis: the basis of each analysis was non-informative before gain-effect sizes and precision. After four chains and a 20,000-simulation burn-in stage, the convergence and subsequent lack of auto-correlation were examined and confirmed; finally, direct probability statements were obtained from an additional 50,000-simulation stage.  We implemented the node-splitting method in order to estimate the consistency between the direct and indirect evidence for the whole study, then chose the consistency model or inconsistency model based on the results.  To obtain a better interpretation of ORs, the probability of every intervention was calculated in order to find the most effective methods based on a Bayesian approach that employs probability values summarized as the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), the significance or difference in the larger the SUCRA value, the better the rank of the intervention.  A cluster analysis was also adopted in order to evaluate the discrepancies the different imaging methods presented in the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. In other words, we can cluster different intervention measures according to the similarity between two specific variables. We can then use the advantages and disadvantages of different imaging methods in judging their overall effect.  R (V.3.2.1) package gemtc (V.0.6) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo engine Open BUGS (V.3.4.0) are both used for making all necessary computations. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Baseline characteristics of included studies \n  \nWe initially sought out and found 2676 voluntary candidate studies. After reviewing the titles and abstracts, we excluded the following: 42 studies as duplicates, 136 as letters or summaries, 286 as non-human studies, and 186 as non-English studies, leaving us with 2026 qualifying remaining articles. After a 2026 assessment of the remaining articles, we excluded an additional 496 case-control studies, 690 studies unrelated to ischemic stroke, 825 studies unrelated to the imaging methods, and 2 studies without either data resources or incomplete documentation. Ultimately, 13 diagnostic tests among the 1226 remaining articles were found eligible for this current network meta-analysis and were subsequently used for further analysis (Appendix Fig. 1).  A total of 1462 patients with ischemic stroke were diagnosed by the gold criteria. The included studies related to the present study were published between 1999 and 2015. All of the subjects involved in the 13 studies were Caucasians. Six of the 13 studies were three-arm trials, with the remaining seven of them being two-arm trials. Baseline characteristics of the included studies are summarized as shown in Table  . The Cochrane risk of bias assessment for all included studies is shown in Figure  . \n  \nThe baseline characteristics for included studies. \n    \nThe QUADAS-2 rating scale for evaluating the quality of the included studies.

The CT methods include traditional CT, CTA, and CTP. The MRI methods include traditional MRI, DWI, and magnetic resonance angiography. Among CT methods, the traditional CT (sensitivity: OR\u200a=\u200a0.16, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.12\u223c0.21; NPV: OR\u200a=\u200a0.30, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.22\u223c0.41; accuracy: OR\u200a=\u200a0.22, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.17\u223c0.27) and CTA (sensitivity: OR\u200a=\u200a4.49, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a3.14\u223c6.41; NPV: OR\u200a=\u200a2.87, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.95\u223c4.22; accuracy: OR\u200a=\u200a3.33, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a2.41\u223c4.61) had a relatively low sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy than CTP. Among the MRI methods, traditional MRI (sensitivity: OR\u200a=\u200a6.42, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.72\u223c23.90; accuracy: OR\u200a=\u200a6.50, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.82\u223c23.21) showed higher sensitivity and accuracy than magnetic resonance angiography; and traditional MRI (sensitivity: OR\u200a=\u200a0.11, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.06\u223c0.21; NPV: OR\u200a=\u200a0.21, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.10\u223c0.47; accuracy: OR\u200a=\u200a0.14, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a0.08\u223c0.26) showed lower sensitivity, NPV and accuracy than DWI. As for ultrasonography, compared with magnetic resonance angiography, transcranial Doppler ultrasound showed higher sensitivity, and accuracy (sensitivity: OR\u200a=\u200a29.17, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a3.42\u223c248.48; accuracy: OR\u200a=\u200a6.50, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.82\u223c23.21) (Table  ). \n  \nEstimated OR and 95%CI of pairwise meta-analysis for sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for ischemia stroke. \n  \n\n### Evidence network of eight imaging methods for the diagnosis of ischemic stroke \n  \nIn terms of sensitivity, we can make the indication that both CT and CTP methods were used by a relatively large number of patients (Fig.  ). \n  \nEvidence images of seven imaging methods for the diagnostic values of ischemic stroke.

Therefore, due to the consistent nature of the results, logically the consistency model was applied. \n\n\n### Network meta-analysis of seven imaging methods for the diagnosis of ischemic stroke \n  \nThe results of this network meta-analysis demonstrated that DWI had a higher sensitivity when compared with those of the traditional CT, CTA, magnetic resonance angiography, and traditional MRI (OR\u200a=\u200a30.0, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a5.7\u223c2.9e+02; OR\u200a=\u200a21.0, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a2.0\u223c4.0e+02; OR\u200a=\u200a1.1e+02, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a4.6\u223c4.8e+03; OR\u200a=\u200a15.0, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a2.0\u223c2.3e+02, respectively). Additionally, DWI still managed to have a relatively higher NPV in comparison with the traditional CT, CTA, CTP, magnetic resonance angiography, and traditional MRI (OR\u200a=\u200a13.0, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a5.6\u223c34.0; OR\u200a=\u200a10.0, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a3.7\u223c33.0; OR\u200a=\u200a4.1, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.5\u223c13.0; OR\u200a=\u200a36.0, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a7.0\u223c2.2e+02; OR\u200a=\u200a4.6, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.9\u223c16.0, respectively). Furthermore, DWI still had a relatively higher accuracy when compared with the traditional CT, CTA, magnetic resonance angiography, and traditional MRI (OR\u200a=\u200a13.0, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a5.0\u223c40.0; OR\u200a=\u200a9.4, 95% C I\u200a=\u200a2.7\u223c42.0; OR\u200a=\u200a43.0, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a7.8\u223c3.1e+02; OR\u200a=\u200a6.7, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a2.3\u223c26.0, respectively) (Fig.   & Appendix Table 1\u20132). These results suggested that DWI had a relatively higher sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy in comparison to the other methods involved traditional CT, CTA, magnetic resonance angiography, and traditional MRI. \n  \nForest plots representing the seven imaging methods for the diagnostic values of ischemic stroke.

As for the MRI methods, DWI showed the higher SUCRA values (sensitivity: 94.13%; specificity: 83.07%; PPV: 90.69%; NPV: 97.74%; accuracy: 98.72%).

We hope that our findings will assist physicians and doctors in choosing the most suitable imaging methods for the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. \n\nThe most important finding in our meta-analysis was that DWI had higher sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy. DWI is the optimal imaging technique for both the diagnosis and management of acute ischemic stroke.  Despite the optimal imaging choice for detecting ischemic strokes, there is still only limited evidence available in regards to the value DWI has in the treatment/management of ischemic stroke with a low-field magnetic resonance system.  The initial DWI lesion volume was demonstrated to be correlated with the final infarct volume as well as both neurological and functional outcomes, which could subsequently serve as an early prognostic tool.  In addition, DWI can be used to accurately monitor the evolution of the ischemic core over time.  Consistent with the results of our findings, Simonsen et al found that DWI had a sensitivity of 90.4% in the diagnosis of ischemic stroke, and an associated smaller study found that the false-negative rate was 5.8% when imaging was carried out within the first 48\u200ahours.  All patients who were eventually diagnosed with ischemic stroke also showed evidence of ischemia by DWI. On the contrary, 25% of patients with ischemic stroke had a normal acute CT scan within 6\u200ahours of initial symptom onset.  A recent study found that DWI determined the existence and location of the infarct, with a 73% sensitivity for detection of ischemic strokes that occurred within three hours of onset and a 92% sensitivity for the occurrence of strokes after a 12-hour onset. Oppositely, the sensitivity of CT for the same time period of detection for stroke after onset was found to be 12% and 16%, respectively.  Another study found that the high b-value of DWI was better served for visualizing and detecting both small and multiple lesions.  One of the advantages that DWI has shown over CT in the detection of acute ischemia is the significantly greater contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR). Furthermore, a study showed that after 48\u200ahours from the stroke onset, DWI showed a higher sensitivity in the detection of ischemic lesion of all clinical stroke subtypes than when compared to CT.  When compared with a CT, DWI was found to be more accurate for the identification of acute infarction and showed a higher sensitivity for the detection of more than 33% MCA involvement.  Consequently, the reliability and reproducibility of CT in detecting and estimating the degree of ischemic stroke change is controversial: it is not easy to distinguish early ischemic changes on CT.  The accuracy of MRI perfusion-diffusion imaging remains superior to CTP, especially inaccurate identification of infarct core.  MRI throughout our study has obviously shown higher accuracy, which can reduce security risks and provide a wider range of information than a standard CT.  DWI has been shown to be the most effective and should be considered effective within 12\u200ahours of the onset of symptoms for the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. \n\nThe cluster analysis revealed that DWI had the highest diagnostic value for ischemic stroke in terms of sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy amongst the seven imaging techniques. The higher diagnostic value of DWI was on the basis of both different imaging methods and the increased edema over time.  However, there were some disadvantages of DWI, which could not be ignored. On the one hand, DWI is incompletely sensitive to patients with only a perfusion lesion (\u201ctotal mismatch\u201d) and cannot be performed in certain patients that have metallic implants, agitation, or claustrophobia.  Additionally, it had been reported that DWI usually takes a longer period of time than CT-based imaging to obtain an imaging. This can lead to potentially harmful results from treatment delay that may outweigh the benefits of a more precise diagnosis.  Copen et al have demonstrated in a previous study that CTP-derived cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps cannot substitute for DWI in the measurement of the ischemic core, for DWI could detect ischemic lesions with a notably high rate.  Another study also suggested that DWI detected more frequently than CT in terms of ischemic lesions in all aspects regions apart from the caudate head and internal capsule.  A study has suggested that DWI is highly accurate for the diagnosis for stroke within 6-h symptom onset, which is superior to CT and conventional MRI.  In addition, during the diagnosis of stroke in the early period, namely 12\u200ahours after presentation, DWI is superior to conventional MRI and CT.  Besides, it has been revealed that DWI should be utilized instead of CT as the approach in stroke imaging for the reason that DWI showed the infarct core in almost every patient with ischemic stroke and indicated the actual minimum range of infarction in almost every patient at the time of imaging.  Furthermore, evidence has revealed that the detectability and detection rate of acute hemisphere infarcts are markedly higher with DWI than with CI.  All these aforementioned evidence has confirmed that DWI is superior to other imaging methods in ischemic stroke. \n\nIn conclusion, the results of this network meta-analysis suggested that DWI showed the highest diagnostic value regarding ischemic stroke in comparison with all of the other imaging methods. Advantages of our study included the wide range of comparison, allowing us to compare all seven different imaging methods in order to assess the diagnostic values of ischemic stroke in patients. However, there existed some limitations in this study. Firstly, noncontrast CT was reported to be more cost-effective for its ability to detect intra-cerebral hemorrhage which will result in therapy adjustment. Although DWI showed higher sensitivity than noncontrast CT, further study is needed to determine the criteria for DWI cost-effective use so as to suggest which patients will benefit from DWI. Second, the inaccuracy of the rankings was evaluated but the true positions of the treatments were not assessed. Third, the present study did not evaluate other factors that might affect the reliability of rankings, like small-study effects across trials or the risk of bias within trials. \n\n\n## Acknowledgments \n  \nThe authors express their sincerest appreciation to reviewers for their progressive feedback. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Conceptualization:   Xiao-Hong Zhang, Hui-Min Liang. \n\n Formal analysis:   Xiao-Hong Zhang, Hui-Min Liang. \n\n Funding acquisition:   Xiao-Hong Zhang, Hui-Min Liang. \n\n Investigation:   Xiao-Hong Zhang, Hui-Min Liang. \n\n Resources:   Hui-Min Liang. \n\n Supervision:   Xiao-Hong Zhang. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   Xiao-Hong Zhang, Hui-Min Liang. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Xiao-Hong Zhang, Hui-Min Liang. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6709059, "text_md5": "5d1afbc7083e52178c96bd4cf3b4c42c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 35], "journal": [36, 56], "publication_year": [58, 62], "title": [73, 117], "keywords": [131, 299], "abstract": [312, 2574], "body": [2583, 25726]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31348236, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000016360", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6709059", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6709059"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6709059\">6709059</a>", "list_title": "PMC6709059  Systematic review with network meta-analysis"}

Based on recent research, an alternative non-selective mechanism was proposed by several authors. Presumably, the inhibitory brain activity may be triggered not only by the presentation of \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli but also by any imperative stimuli, including Go stimuli, when the context is uncertain. Earlier support for this notion was mainly based on the absence of a significant difference between neural activity evoked by equiprobable Go and NoGo stimuli. Equiprobable Go/NoGo design with a simple response time task limits potential confounds between response inhibition and accompanying cognitive processes while not preventing prepotent automaticity. However, previous neuroimaging studies used classical null hypothesis significance testing, making it impossible to accept the null hypothesis. Therefore, the current research aimed to provide evidence for the practical equivalence of neuronal activity in the Go and NoGo trials using Bayesian analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Thirty-four healthy participants performed a cued Go/NoGo task with an equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli. To independently localize brain areas associated with response inhibition in similar experimental conditions, we performed a meta-analysis of fMRI studies using equal-probability Go/NoGo tasks. As a result, we observed overlap between response inhibition areas and areas that demonstrate the practical equivalence of neuronal activity located in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and left inferior frontal gyrus. Thus, obtained results favour the existence of non-selective response inhibition, which can act in settings of contextual uncertainty induced by the equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nResponse inhibition is the ability to suppress inappropriate, automatic, reflexive, or habitual prepotent responses to produce a controlled goal-directed response . It is generally accepted in the literature that response inhibition works in close relation to other processes associated with cognitive control, such as working memory, voluntary attention, conflict monitoring, and action selection . Moreover, response inhibition is thought to represent a multifaceted phenomenon rather than a unitary brain mechanism. A distinction is made between action cancellation and action restraint  as well as between reactive and proactive response inhibition mechanisms . \n\nAccording to the conventional view, the response inhibition process is selectively triggered by \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli that result in increased neuronal activity in brain structures responsible for inhibitory control . However, in several cases, the concept of selective response inhibition fails to explain observed behavioural and neurophysiological phenomena. Manipulating the probability of the occurrence of \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli and the subjects\u2019 awareness of the probability of the appearance may slow down the motor response . Moreover, when necessary to rapidly suppress a specific action, the action is inhibited along with all other potential actions. That is, such inhibition can affect the entire motor system . In an attempt to explain the effects mentioned above, several authors proposed the concept of non-selective (\u201cglobal\u201d) response inhibition . It is thought that these non-selective mechanisms serve to prevent inappropriate or premature responses at the expense of the speed of execution of correct actions. First, response inhibition mechanisms may non-selectively inhibit all potential responses to further selectively execute an appropriate response (non-selective inhibition of multiple concurrent motor responses). Second, inhibition may be triggered not only by the presentation of \u201cinhibitory\u201d stimuli but also by the occurrence of any imperative stimuli instructing on the necessity to suppress or execute a prepared action (non-selectivity of inhibitory stimulus perception). In the present work, we consider the latter mechanism. \n\nA tentative neurophysiological model of the non-selective or \u201cglobal\u201d response inhibition involved in the resolution of interference between several competing response options was proposed by Frank  and included the cortico-subthalamic \u201chyper-direct\u201d pathway  which is capable of rapidly and non-selectively suppress all potential response options. As the research area developed, it was hypothesized that the model might be applied not only to tasks with multiple concurrent response options but also to simpler tasks where the subject has to choose between executing and refraining from an action . The authors used a cued equiprobable Go/NoGo task, wherein a preparatory cue stimulus indicated the probability of a NoGo stimulus occurrence. A simple equiprobable Go/NoGo was chosen instead of a complex Go/NoGo task to limit confounds between response inhibition and the accompanying cognitive processes . Complex Go/NoGo tasks usually utilize the low probability of NoGo stimulus, difficulties in identifying NoGo signals, high attentional or working memory loads. Although one of the possible ways to build up a prepotent response tendency is to bias the Go/NoGo probabilities in favour of Go stimuli, it is not necessary when the design involves a simple speeded reaction time task with a single response and reduces the complexity of the identification of Go and NoGo signals to a single bit of information . In these conditions, a stimulus that does not require a response elicits subthreshold automatic motor activations that do not become overt because they are counteracted by fast automatic response inhibition . \n\nWithin the framework of the selective inhibition model, the inhibition process would only be triggered by the identification of the NoGo stimulus. According to the hypothesis of non-selective inhibition, when the context is uncertain (equal probability of NoGo and Go stimuli), the need for response inhibition arises for both NoGo and Go trials. Experimental assessment of the hypotheses revealed no statistically significant differences between the NoGo and Go trials in both the amplitude of the early components of event-related potentials (ERP)  and the level of neuronal activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . At the same time, a significant difference in early ERP amplitudes (peaked at 170\u00a0ms) was found in uncertain equiprobable NoGo and Go trials compared to certain Go-control trials, where no inhibition is required . The authors considered this fact as evidence for the presence of a \u201cnon-selective\u201d inhibitory mechanism that is not specific to the processing of NoGo signals. The analysis of early ERP components suggests that non-selective inhibition may blindly suppress any automatic response when the context is uncertain, acting as a gating mechanism controlling the initiation of a prepared, prepotent response. \n\nHowever, a critical limitation of the above-mentioned studies was that the authors could not accept the null hypothesis, so they did not provide direct proof of the practical equivalence of neuronal activity level between Go and NoGo trials in inhibition-related brain structures. Indeed, within the framework of classical (frequentist) null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we cannot accept the null hypothesis based on the absence of a significant difference. We can only reject it. Thus, the question of experimental support for non-selective response inhibition remains unanswered, and answering this question requires overcoming the methodological limitation of NHST, which is possible using Bayesian statistics . \n\nTherefore, the present study aimed to verify the non-selective response inhibition hypothesis by using the fMRI data from an equiprobable Go/NoGo task. Based on the results of previous studies, it may be suggested that if the hypothesis on the non-selectivity of inhibition is correct, then the brain structures responsible for response inhibition will demonstrate practically equivalent levels of neuronal activity in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials. Bayesian parameter inference (BPI) was applied to assess this prediction. Instead, if the hypothesis on the selectivity of response inhibition is correct, then activation of inhibition-related brain structures will be observed in the NoGo conditions compared to the Go conditions. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### A meta-analysis of fMRI studies using equal probability Go/NoGo tasks \n  \nGiven that a practically equivalent level of neuronal activity can be identified not only for response inhibition-related structures, but also, for example, those related to sensory processing of visual stimuli, working memory, and attention, we conducted a meta-analysis of fMRI studies to independently localize brain structures associated with response inhibition. Studies using equal probability Go/NoGo tasks were selected for meta-analysis. We searched for studies that, similar to the investigation by Albares et al.  and Criaud et al. , compared neuronal activity in the condition of equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli with the control Go condition, in which the subject did not need to inhibit the prepared action. We hypothesized that inhibition would be non-selectively elicited by both equiprobable Go and NoGo-stimuli when the context is uncertain. To test the non-selective inhibition hypothesis, we considered similar Go/NoGo tasks with an equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo-stimuli. We did not consider Go/NoGo tasks with rare NoGo-stimuli, since studies using them have previously shown the involvement of selective response inhibition . \n\nWe searched for these studies in the PubMed database in the period from 01/01/2000 to 15/07/2019 using the following keywords: \u201c((fmri) OR (functional magnetic resonance)) AND ((nogo) OR (no-go)).\u201d Four additional studies were identified through manual searches. As a result, 726 papers were identified. At the first stage of selection, we excluded reviews, meta-analyses and papers repeatedly reporting the results of fMRI studies (see the flow chart of analysis in Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nFlow chart of study selection in the meta-analysis. \n  \n\nStudies dealing with Flanker task modifications of Go/NoGo task or based on unequal probability of appearance of Go and NoGo trials were also excluded from the analysis. As a result, 593 papers were excluded. The task designs of the remaining 113 papers provided for equal probability Go and NoGo stimuli presentation. At the next step, 82 of the papers were excluded based on the following criteria: auditory and sensorimotor Go/NoGo tasks were used; only emotion-laden task conditions were used (emotionally neutral conditions were either absent or not considered separately); required Go-control condition (100% probability of the Go stimulus presentation) was not used; the coordinates for the contrast of interest \u201c50/50% Go/NoGo\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control\u201d within a group of healthy subjects were not reported. In 11 out of the 31 remaining studies, healthy volunteer subjects under the age of 18 (children and adolescents) were studied. These articles were also excluded from the analysis because this study focused on brain activity of healthy, adult subjects. In all remaining studies except one, only block designs were used. To make our sample more homogeneous, we excluded the only eligible study with an event-related design . The final meta-analysis included 20 studies (452 healthy subjects, mean age 29\u00a0years) with a total of 210 foci (for more details, see the \u201c \u201d, Table  ). All coordinates were converted into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the Lancaster transform . The number of studies included in the current meta-analysis meets the minimum recommended number of 17\u201320 studies . \n\nCoordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) was performed using the random-effects activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm  implemented in the GingerALE 3.0.2 software ( ) and Seed-based   d   Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) algorithm  implemented in the SDM-PSI 6.22 software ( ). Two different CBMA algorithms were used for the cross-method validation. \n\nThe ALE algorithm assesses the spatial convergence between neuroimaging studies by modelling spatial uncertainty of activation foci using isotropic three-dimensional Gaussian probability functions with the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) inversely related to the square root of the sample size of the original study . An ALE map is obtained by computing the union of activation probabilities across studies for each voxel and tested against a null distribution of random spatial convergence between studies . The empirical validations  showed that the optimal FWHM largely depends on the data and may be substantially larger than proposed in . The spatial smoothness of our fMRI data after preprocessing was 13.5\u00a0mm, as estimated by the SPM12 (Statistical parametric mapping) software package ( ). Since our objective was to find an overlap between the results of the meta-analysis and the Bayesian analysis of the obtained fMRI data, we used an additional FWHM of 4\u00a0mm for the ALE meta-analysis. It allowed us to achieve a median kernel FWHM of 13.5\u00a0mm. We used a cluster-level extend threshold of 0.05 corrected for family-wise error (FWE) with an uncorrected cluster-forming threshold of 0.001 (5000 threshold permutations) recommended for the ALE analysis . \n\nThe alternative CBMA algorithm, SDM-PSI, considers not only the coordinates of the activation foci, but also the effect sizes. The SDM-PSI algorithm recreates 3D effect size images for each study using t-values of the peak coordinates and anisotropic kernels . It has been shown that the recreation substantially improved by fully anisotropic kernels and did not depend on the FWHM . We performed the SDM-PSI meta-analysis using the same coordinates as for the ALE meta-analysis adding peak t-values (z-values were converted to t-values). We used the default kernel (\u03b1\u2009=\u20091, FWHM\u2009=\u200920\u00a0mm) and threshold (threshold-free cluster enhancement FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05 with 5000 permutations) recommended by SDM developers . \n\n\n### Subjects \n  \nThe recruitment of subjects for the present fMRI study was carried out in two stages. At the first stage, the sample size was 20 subjects (16 women, aged (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) 23.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6). To protect from the potential impact of relatively small sample size on the observed null-effects a retrospective power analysis was carried out, which suggested increasing the sample size up to 34 subjects. Therefore, the final sample consisted of 34 healthy, right-handed volunteer subjects (24 women, aged 25.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2). An Oldfield test was used to determine the dominant arm . The subject volunteers signed a written informed consent to participate in the study and were paid for their participation. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the N.P. Bechtereva Institute of the Human Brain of the Russian Academy of Sciences. \n\n\n### Power analysis \n  \nTo perform power analysis, we used the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomic LA5c dataset  as it contains fMRI data from a relatively large cohort (N\u2009=\u2009115) of healthy subjects performing a stop-signal task (see \u201c \u201d for details). This classical inhibitory paradigm models a situation in which inhibitory brain activity is selectively triggered by infrequent inhibitory stimuli (stop signal) but not by Go stimuli . The mean effect sizes for the selective inhibition contrast (\u201cCorrect-Stop\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d contrast, see Fig.  ) were estimated within the cortical brain regions revealed by the current meta-analysis. They ranged from 0.57 to 1.12 Cohen\u2019s d. Power analysis was performed using GPower 3.1.9.7 . It indicated that the sample size of 34 subjects would be sufficient to detect the minimum expected selective inhibition effect (d\u2009=\u20090.57, two-tailed one-sample test, alpha\u2009=\u20090.05) with a power of 0.9 (see Fig.  ). The power of 0.8 or 0.9 is commonly used for sample size calculations . \n\nHowever, it is worth noting that obtaining non-significant results with high retrospective power (based on an independent dataset) or high prospective power would not provide direct evidence for the null hypothesis ). To provide evidence for the null hypothesis, Bayesian inference or frequentist equivalence testing should be used . Accordingly, in the current study, all conclusions on the non-selective response inhibition were made only on the basis of the Bayesian analysis and its overlap with the meta-analysis. Results for the classical NHST were added only to illustrate how the more familiar frequentist inference relates to Bayesian inference. \n\n\n### Experimental task and study procedure \n  \nWe used a paired stimulus modification of the Go/NoGo task (see Fig.\u00a0 ) . This task was originally developed to dissociate cognitive processes, such as response inhibition, conflict monitoring, sensory mismatch and category discrimination . Given that imperative Go and NoGo stimuli were presented in an equiprobable manner this modification of the Go/NoGo task was used for the purposes of the current study. Each trial consisted of the two consequently presented stimuli. The first preparatory cue stimulus warned the subjects on the presentation of the second, imperative stimulus, or indicated no need for any response to the second stimulus. The study included two variants of the experiment\u2019s instructions. According to the first instruction (see Fig.\u00a0 A), the subject should press the response button as soon as possible upon presentation of the pair of images \u201canimal-animal\u201d (\u201cA-A Go\u201d trials) and refrain from acting upon presentation of the pair \u201canimal-plant\u201d (\u201cA-P NoGo\u201d trials). According to the instructions of the second experiment (see Fig.\u00a0 B), the subject acts after presentation of the pair \u201canimal-plant\u201d (\u201cA-P Go\u201d trials) and suppresses an action upon presentation of the pair \u201canimal-animal\u201d (\u201cA-A NoGo\u201d trials). The subjects were familiarized with the task just before scanning to ensure they understood the instructions. Additionally, before each fMRI session, the subjects were reminded of the need to react to Go stimuli as quickly as possible while refraining from reacting to NoGo stimuli.   \nExperimental design of the Go/NoGo task. S1\u2014first stimulus (preparatory cue). S2\u2014second stimulus (imperative stimulus). A\u2014images of animals, P\u2014images of plants. (  A  ) First experiment: \u201cA-A Go\u201d, \u201cA-P NoGo\u201d. (  B  ) Second experiment: \u201cA-P Go\u201d, \u201cA-A NoGo\u201d. Red boxes highlight trials that were compared to test the hypothesis of selective and non-selective response inhibition. \n  \n\nIn both experiments, if the first stimulus presented was an image of a \u201cplant,\u201d subjects do not need to take any actions in response to the presentation of any second stimuli of a trial. In such a trial, the subject should ignore the second stimulus and wait for the next pair of stimuli (\u201cP-A Ignore\u201d and \u201cP-P Ignore\u201d trials). Accordingly, it was assumed that there is no inhibition of the prepared action in \u201cIgnore\u201d conditions. The \u201cIgnore\u201d trials were included in the adopted Go/NoGo task to assess preparatory brain activity, such as preparing to receive a relevant stimulus (attentional set) and preparing to make a movement (motor set), by comparing them to Go and NoGo trials. However, the issue related to the preparatory processes is beyond the scope of the present study. Fifty pairs of each type of stimuli were randomly presented in each experiment. The order of following the instructions was counterbalanced among the subjects. Two variants of the present Go/NoGo task allowed us to control the differences in the load on working memory between A-P/A-A\u2013Go/NoGo stimuli . \n\nThe fMRI data obtained using this experimental task allowed us to test the hypothesis on the   non-selectivity   of response inhibition in the current study, since a similar task design was previously used for the same purpose by Criaud et al. . The imperative Go and NoGo stimuli were presented after the preparatory stimulus with equal probability, as reported in event-related studies by . To build up prepotent tendency to react, subjects were instructed to press the button with their right thumb as quickly as possible. This is a case of a simple speeded reaction time task with a single response and only one bit of information. It is known that these conditions elicit subthreshold automatic motor activations . According to G.A. Miller: \u201cOne bit of information is the amount of information that we need to make a decision between two equally likely alternatives\u201d . Here, it refers to discrimination between \u201canimal\u201d and \u201cplant\u201d stimuli. \n\nSuch an equally probable presentation of imperative stimuli provides several advantages. First, it minimizes the difference in cognitive load between Go and NoGo conditions arising from task complexity . Second, such a design enables the exclusion of effects associated with a low frequency of the NoGo stimuli presentation (\u201coddball\u201d effects) confounding the effect of inhibition . Third, it creates maximum uncertainty regarding the probability of the presentation of an imperative stimulus, thus minimizes the conflict between two response types, making it possible to distinguish between error monitoring and conflict resolution processes on the one hand and response inhibition processes on the other . \n\nIn total, 100 NoGo trials, 100 Go trials, 100 P-A Ignore trials, and 100 P-P Ignore trials were presented over two experimental sessions. In the absence of stimulation, a fixation cross was displayed in the centre of the screen. The stimuli were presented for 100\u00a0ms, and the interstimulus interval was 1000\u00a0ms. The intertrial interval jittered from 2800 to 3200\u00a0ms with an increment step of 100\u00a0ms. Additionally, to improve design efficiency, 100 zero events (fixation crosses) were randomly inserted between the stimuli pairs (trials), and their duration jittered from 3000 to 5000\u00a0ms with an increment size of 500\u00a0ms. The action to be performed consisted of pressing a button with the right thumb. The duration of one task session was 17.5\u00a0min. Before starting the fMRI study, the subjects performed a training task. The Invivo\u2019s Eloquence fMRI System (Invivo, Orlando, FL, USA) was used to deliver the stimuli, synchronize with fMRI acquisition, and record reaction times of subjects\u2019 bottom pressing. The task presentation sequence and all temporal parameters of the stimuli presentation were programmed using the E-prime 2.0 software package (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). \n\n\n### Image acquisition \n  \nA Philips Achieva 3.0 Tesla scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) was used for the study. The structural T1-images were registered with the following parameters: field of view (FOV)\u2014240\u2009\u00d7\u2009240\u00a0mm, repetition time (TR)\u201425\u00a0ms, echo time (TE)\u20142.2\u00a0ms, 130 axial slices with a thickness of 1\u00a0mm and pixel size of 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u00a0mm, flip angle\u201430\u00b0. For the registration of T2*-images, a single-pulse echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used. The period of data registration from 31 axial slices was 2\u00a0s (TR\u2009=\u20092\u00a0s, TE\u2009=\u200935\u00a0ms). The following parameters were employed: FOV\u2014200\u2009\u00d7\u2009186\u00a0mm, flip angle\u201490\u00b0, voxel size\u20143\u2009\u00d7\u20093x3 mm. Two dummy scans were performed prior to each session. To minimize head movements, we used an MR-compatible soft cervical collar and foam padding. \n\n\n### Preprocessing of fMRI images \n  \nImage preprocessing included the following: realignment to the first image of the session, slice time correction, co-registration, segmentation, normalization to an MNI template, and spatial smoothing (8\u00a0mm FWHM). Preprocessing and statistical analyses of the images were performed using an SPM12. To assess head motion during the scanning, we calculated the framewise displacement (FD) as the sum of the absolute values of the derivatives of the six realignment parameters . The mean FD across two runs ranged from 0.07 to 0.36\u00a0mm (group mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation was 0.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u00a0mm). The average percentage of time points with FD over 0.9\u00a0mm was 1\u2009\u00b1\u20092%. We used all time points for the analysis since all subjects had >\u200990% volumes under the FD threshold of 0.9\u00a0mm . \n\n\n### Lateralized BOLD response analysis \n  \nOne of the electrophysiological indicators of overt and covert motor activations is the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) . The equiprobable Go/NoGo study by Hong et al.  showed an increase of the right-hand target-related LRP (\u201cC3 minus C4\u201d ERP difference) in NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials, which was considered as evidence of a prepotent response tendency. The fMRI analogue of LRP is the Lateralized BOLD response (LBR) . Therefore, we used the LBR to index prepotent motor activations under task settings of the present study. The right-hand LBR was calculated as the mean BOLD signal in the left sensorimotor cortex (SM) minus the right SM cortex (\u201cL SM minus R SM\u201d BOLD difference). BOLD signal was estimated within 0.5\u00a0s time bins from the target onset time using finite impulse response models (time window from 1 to 12\u00a0s). Regions of interest (ROIs) located in the SM cortex were defined as the overlap between anatomical and a priori functional masks . Functional masks were obtained using the Neurosynth platform for an automatic meta-analysis ( ). We used a uniformity test with a default false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p\u2009<\u20090.01 threshold for the \u201cmotor\u201d term (2565 studies). To obtain anatomical masks, we used voxels with the maximum probability for \u201cprecentral gyrus\u201d and \u201cprecentral gyrus\u201d labels according to the probabilistic Harvard\u2013Oxford atlas . ROI analysis was performed using one-sample and paired-sample t-tests with FDR correction for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis of fMRI data \n  \nThe first level of analysis was conducted using frequentist parameter estimation. The second level of analysis was performed using both the frequentist and Bayesian parameter estimation . In general, using Bayesian analysis on the second level does not presuppose Bayesian parameter estimation at the first level of analysis. One can combine computationally less demanding frequentist parameter estimation for single subjects with Bayesian estimation and inference at the group level . Onset times of second stimuli presentation (separately for \u201cA-A Go\u201d, \u201cA-P NoGo\u201d, \u201cP-A Ignore Exp1\u201d, \u201cP-P Ignore Exp1\u201d, and also \u201cA-P Go\u201d, \u201cA-A NoGo\u201d, \u201cP-A Ignore Exp2\u201d, \u201cP-P Ignore Exp2\u201d), erroneous button pressing, and missing the responding in Go trials were used to create regressors of the general linear model (GLM) for each subject. Events were impulse responses with a duration of zero convolved with the canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF). We also performed an additional analysis with the temporal and dispersion derivatives for all task regressors to take into account the unknown BOLD delay. Low-frequency drift was removed by temporal high-pass filtering with a cut-off frequency of 1/128\u00a0Hz. Six head motion parameters were included in the GLM as nuisance regressors to account for the movement artefacts . Beta coefficients reflecting an increase in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the experimental condition relative to the implicit baseline were scaled to percent signal change (PSC) following the procedure recommended in [Ref. , p.186]. To this end, the beta coefficients for each condition were divided by the mean value of the beta coefficients for the constant term and multiplied by 100 and a scaling factor (SF) needed so that the peak of an isolated BOLD response is equal to one (SF\u2009=\u20090.21). Two linear contrasts of scaled beta coefficients were calculated: (1) 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cA-P NoGo\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A NoGo\u201d]\u20140.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cA-P Go\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A Go\u201d]   (the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d comparison);   (2) 0.25\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cA-P NoGo\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A NoGo\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-P Go\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cA-A Go\u201d]\u20140.25\u2009\u00d7\u2009[\u201cP-A Ignore Exp1\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cP-P Ignore Exp1\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cP-A Ignore Exp2\u201d\u2009+\u2009\u201cP-P Ignore Exp2\u201d]   (the \u201cGo  \u2009+\u2009  NoGo vs. Ignore\u201d comparison).   The sum of positive contrast weights was equal to one. The contrasts from 34 subjects were used as variables to verify the hypotheses on selective and non-selective response inhibition at the second level of analysis. Only grey matter voxels were included in the second-level analysis, as we did not expect to detect the BOLD signal changes in white matter associated with the Go/NoGo task performance. To that end, a mask was created based on the segmentation of each subject\u2019s structural T1-images. \n\n\n### Verification of the hypotheses on selective and non-selective response inhibition \n  \nAs in previous studies employing equiprobable Go/NoGo task with a single prepotent motor response, in the current study, non-selectivity refers to the perceptual decision mechanisms involved in the detection, discrimination, or identification of sensory stimuli . In particular, we did not consider non-selectivity related to decision mechanisms that involve the selection between multiple alternative responses, which confound response inhibition processes in choice reaction time tasks . The former type of non-selectivity implies that any imperative stimuli (both Go and NoGo stimuli) would trigger response inhibition when the context is uncertain because of equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli. The latter type of non-selectivity, usually called \u201cglobal\u201d inhibition, implies that inhibition affects all alternative responses, including the selected response . \n\nWe tested the hypotheses on selective and non-selective response inhibition using the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d comparison. In the case of the   selectivity   of response inhibition, we expect to find a selective increase in the neuronal activity in response to the presentation of NoGo stimuli compared to Go stimuli (\u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d). In the case of the   non-selectivity   of response inhibition, we expect to find a practically equivalent increase in the neuronal activity in response to the presentation of both NoGo and Go stimuli (\u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d) in the brain areas related to the response inhibition, which were independently localized by the current meta-analysis (\u201c50/50% Go/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d). Additionally, we used the \u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo vs. Ignore\u201d comparison to distinguish between the brain areas that are simply not activated in current task settings (\u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009=\u2009Ignore\u201d) from the brain areas activated in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials, where no inhibition is required (\u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009>\u2009Ignore\u201d). Thus, to identify the non-selective response inhibition in the settings of contextual uncertainty induced by the equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli, it was necessary to show a three-way overlap between (1) inhibitory-related brain areas according to the meta-analysis (\u201c50/50% Go/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d), (2) brain areas with practically equivalent neuronal activity in Go and NoGo trials (\u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d) and (3) brain areas activated in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials (\u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009>\u2009Ignore\u201d). This conjunction analysis was performed by binarization and multiplication of thresholded images . \n\nTo reveal brain areas with practically equivalent neuronal activity in the Go and NoGo trials (\u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d), one has to provide evidence for the null hypothesis. The classical NHST approach estimates the probability (p-value) of obtaining actual data\u2019s best-fitting parameter value,   \u03b2  , or something more extreme under the null hypothesis that the experimental effect is   \u03b8  \u2009=\u2009  c\u03b2  \u2009=\u2009  0.   The null hypothesis can never be accepted using NHST because the p-value does not represent the probability of the null hypothesis, and the probability that an effect equals exactly zero is itself zero . A non-significant result can be obtained in two cases : (1) there is no effect, and our data are against the alternative hypothesis; or (2) our data are insufficient to distinguish alternative hypothesis from the null hypothesis, and we cannot confidently make any inference (low statistical power). When the result obtained is not significant, it is recommended to use frequentist equivalence testing  or Bayesian inference  to provide evidence for the null hypothesis. In the present study, Bayesian parameter inference (BPI) was used . \n\nThe Bayesian approach estimates the posterior probability   (PP)   distribution of the effect   \u03b8  , given the data using the likelihood and the prior knowledge. For the second-level Bayesian analysis, SPM12 implements the hierarchical parametric empirical Bayes approach with the global shrinkage prior . It represents a prior belief that, on average, in the whole brain, there is no global experimental effect. If the posterior probability of the effect exceeding the effect size threshold,   \u03b3,   is greater than the predefined probability threshold,   \u03b1  \u2009=\u200995%, then the hypothesis on the presence of \u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d effect will be accepted (see Fig.  A in the \u201c \u201d): \n\nIf the effect value falls within the interval [\u2212\u2009  \u03b3  ;   \u03b3  ] with a probability of   \u03b1  \u2009=\u20090.95, then the hypothesis of the null \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d effect will be accepted, supporting the practical equivalence  of the BOLD signal between the conditions compared (see Fig.  B): \n\nThe interval [\u2212\u2009  y  ;   y  ] can be thought of as the neuronal \u201cbackground noise level\u201d  or as a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) that expresses which effect size values (PSC) are equivalent to the null value for current practical purposes . \n\nThe hypothesis on the presence of the \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d effect will be accepted if (see Fig.  C): \n\nIf none of the above criteria are satisfied, the data in particular voxel are insufficient to distinguish the null hypothesis from the alternative hypothesis (\u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels, see Fig.  D) . For such voxels, it is impossible to make any inference confidently, so we need to increase the sample size or scanning time. In the current study, our conclusions were based only on voxels in which the effect size values (PSC) fell within or outside the interval [\u2212\u2009  \u03b3  ;   \u03b3  ] with the   PP  \u2009>\u20090.95. Thus, for these voxels, the data obtained are sufficient to make an inference confidently. This decision rule is also known as the \u201cROPE-only\u201d decision rule [ ; see Fig.  ]. It was applied to the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d and \u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo vs. Ignore\u201d comparisons. BPI was performed using the   BayInf   toolbox based on SPM12 ( ) . BPI based on the \u201cROPE-only\u201d decision rule with a zero-effect size threshold corresponds to the false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons within the NHST framework . The group-level effect size threshold   \u03b3   was set at one standard deviation of the prior variance of the contrast (prior SD ), which is the default in SPM12 . Simulations showed that this threshold provides high sensitivity to both \u201cactivated\u201d and \u201cnot activated\u201d voxels while protecting against incorrect decisions . BPI with the ES threshold of one prior SD  typically detect similar \u201cactivations\u201d as classical NHST inference with a voxel-wise FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05 . To illustrate this, the BPI results were compared with the classical NHST results. For visualization purposes, the posterior probabilities were converted to the logarithmic posterior odds, LogOdds\u2009=\u2009log(  PP  /(1\u2009\u2212\u2009  PP  )). LogOdds\u2009>\u20093 correspond to   PP  \u2009>\u20090.95. Anatomical localization of clusters was identified using xjView toolbox ( ). \n\n\n### Sequential analyses \n  \nSince the statistical analysis was carried out twice, for the sample size N\u2009=\u200920 and N\u2009=\u200934, the question of \u201cdata peeking\u201d should be addressed. \u201cData peeking\u201d refers to the practice when a researcher periodically re-analyses sequentially obtained data and decides to stop data collection as soon as significant results are obtained . Sequential analyses and optional stopping in the classical NHST framework substantially inflate the number of false positives and require special adjustments of the p-values along with the definition of the stopping rule based on the power analysis . In contrast, Bayesian inference based on the posterior probabilities or Bayes factors does not depend on stopping intentions and does not necessarily require power analysis . Therefore, the issue of \u201cdata peeking\u201d may be mitigated by the usage of Bayesian statistics . \n\nWithin the classical NHST framework, a statistically significant difference may be shown in any voxel with a sufficiently large sample size, even when the effect is trivial or has no practical significance . Thus, with an unbounded increase of the data, the number of statistically significant voxels will approach 100% of the total number of voxels [see, for example ]. At the same time, Bayesian inference allows one to find not only \u201cactivated\u201d voxels but also \u201cnull effect\u201d voxels with a trivial difference (practical equivalence) and \u201clow confidence\u201d voxels for which obtained data are not sufficient. Increasing sample size using BPI will lead to the situation when the number of \u201cactivated\u201d and \u201cnull effect\u201d voxels reaches a plateau. When the plateau was reached, it is reasonable to stop the data collection. To illustrate how this relates to the current study, we provide an analysis of the dependencies between the sample size and the number of \u201cactivated\u201d, \u201cnull effect,\u201d and \u201clow confidence\u201d voxels for the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d comparison. To plot these dependencies, the analysis was performed for the samples from 6 to 34 subjects with a step of 2 subjects (see the \u201c \u201d). In total thirty random groups were sampled for each step. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Meta-analysis \n  \nAs a result of the ALE meta-analysis of 20 fMRI studies, we identified the brain structures that were characterized by increased neuronal activity demonstrated in settings of equal probability Go and NoGo stimuli presentation compared to the control Go conditions (\u201c50/50% Go/NoGo blocks >\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d contrast): (1) right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), (2) right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), (3) right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), (4) bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and anterior insula (also known as anterior insula/frontal operculum (AIFO)), (5) right premotor cortex (PMC) and frontal eye field (FEF), (6) bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and supplementary motor area (SMA), and (7) bilateral thalamus (see Fig.\u00a0 , Table  ). The SDM-PSI results were generally consistent with the ALE results, with the only difference being the absence of clusters in the subcortex (see Fig.   and Table   in the \u201c \u201d). Therefore, below, we consider only clusters in the cerebral cortex.   \nResults of the ALE meta-analysis. The result of the meta-analysis of 20 fMRI studies using equal probability Go/NoGo tasks (\u201c50/50% Go/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d contrast). Figure was created using MRIcroGL 1.2.2 software ( ). \n    \nThe result of the ALE meta-analysis of 20 fMRI studies using equal probability Go/NoGo tasks (\u201c50/50% Go/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d contrast). \n  \n DLPFC   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,   IFG   inferior frontal gyrus,   AIFO   anterior insula/frontal operculum,   TPJ   temporoparietal junction,   SMA   supplementary motor area,   ACC   anterior cingulate cortex,   PMC   premotor cortex,   FEF   frontal eye field,   IPL   inferior parietal lobule. \n  \n\n\n### Behavioural data \n  \nIn two fMRI sessions, the mean response omission in Go trials was 2.97\u2009\u00b1\u20093.92%. The mean of false alarms in NoGo trials was 0.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.64%. The mean response time (RT) was 384\u2009\u00b1\u200960\u00a0ms. \n\n\n### fMRI data \n  \nNeither classical NHST with the voxel-wise FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05 nor Bayesian inference applied in the present fMRI study revealed a significant increase in the neuronal activity in NoGo trials compared to the Go trials. No significant increases were revealed using a less conservative threshold-free cluster enhancement FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05 and a voxel-wise uncorrected threshold of 0.005. Additional analysis with the temporal and dispersion derivatives also did not reveal a significant \u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d effect predicted by the hypothesis of selective response inhibition. \n\nThe reversed \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d contrast showed the expected motor activations in the pre- and postcentral gyrus, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, subcortical regions and cerebellum (see Fig.\u00a0  and Tables  , Tables   in the \u201c \u201d). Both statistical methods revealed similar activation patterns for the \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d effect (Dice coefficient\u2009=\u20090.8), demonstrating the consistency between the BPI with   \u03b3  \u2009=\u20091 prior SD  and LogOdds\u2009>\u20093   (PP  \u2009>\u20090.95) thresholding approach and NHST with the voxel-wise FWE-corrected threshold of 0.05.   \nResults of classical voxel-wise and Bayesian parameter inference.

The \u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d effect was not detected by any of the methods. Red colour depicts the \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d effect.

White colour depicts (  A  ) non-significant voxels and (  B  ) \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels. Figure was created using Mango 4.1 software ( ). \n  \n\nAt the same time, Bayesian analysis has made it possible to define brain structures with practically equivalent neuronal activity in Go and NoGo trials. The null \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d effect was revealed for a widely distributed set of regions throughout the entire brain surrounding clusters of activations revealed in the \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d contrast (see Fig.\u00a0 A). The \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d regions were separated from activation clusters by regions that consisted of \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels . For \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels, the data obtained are insufficient to accept or reject the null hypothesis. The number of \u201clow-confidence\u201d voxels were decreased with increasing sample size (see Fig.   in the \u201c \u201d). The largest gain in the number of \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d and \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d voxels can be noted from 6 to 20 subjects. After 20 subjects, the dependencies between the sample size and the number of \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d and \u201cGo\u2009>\u2009NoGo\u201d voxels reached a plateau. This is also confirmed by the similarity between the BPI results for the sample size of 20 and 34 subjects (Dice coefficient\u2009=\u20090.88 for the \"NoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\" effect, see also Fig.   and Table   in the \u201c \u201d). \n\nIt should be noted that the \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d area cannot be reasonably split into several parts, such as activation clusters. Therefore, we limited ourselves to specifying the anatomic localization of brain areas where the \u201cNoGo\u2009=\u2009Go\u201d area overlaps with the clusters revealed by the current meta-analysis and brain areas activated by equiprobable Go and NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials (see \u201c \u201d for the \u201cGo\u2009+\u2009NoGo\u2009>\u2009Ignore\u201d contrast in the \u201c \u201d, Fig.   and Table  ). \n\n\n### LBR analysis \n  \nThe right-hand LBRs were analysed to assess the prepotent motor tendency in equiprobable Go/NoGo task settings. We did not find a significant increase in LBR above zero for the Ignore condition in any of the analysed time bins (see Table   in the \u201c \u201d). At the same time, we found a significant increase in LBR in the NoGo trials compared to the Ignore trials for time bins from 2.5 to 5.5\u00a0s (pFDR\u2009<\u20090.05). Therefore, the revealed increase in LBR supports the presence of prepotent motor activity in the NoGo trials (see Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nLBRs for the right hand (\u201cL SM minus R SM\u201d BOLD difference).

Figure was created using MRIcroGL 1.2.2 software ( ). \n  \n\n\n### Conjunction analysis \n  \nAs it can be inferred from the revealed overlap between the results of the ALE meta-analysis and the results of the abovementioned Bayesian analysis, only a few of the brain structures demonstrated (1) increased activity in the \u201c50/50% Go/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d meta-analytical comparison, (2) the practical equivalence of the BOLD signal in the \u201cNoGo vs. Go\u201d comparison and (3) activation in Go and NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials. Three-way overlap was observed in (1) right DLPFC, (2) right IPL, (3) right TPJ, (4) left IFG and anterior insula (AIFO), (5) right PMC, and FEF (see Fig.\u00a0 , Table  ). The results of the three-way overlap obtained using the SDM-PSI meta-analysis were generally consistent with the ALE overlap (see Fig.   and Table   in the \u201c \u201d). Two additional clusters were revealed using SDM-PSI meta-analysis: (1) left ACC/preSMA (BA 32) and (2) right anterior insula. In the discussion, we considered only those clusters that were found in three-way overlaps for both meta-analyses.   \nThree-way overlap between the ALE meta-analysis and Bayesian analysis.

Bayesian analysis of the obtained fMRI data provides evidence of the practical equivalence of neuronal activity evoked by Go and NoGo stimuli in several brain structures. According to the results of our meta-analysis, some of these brain structures, including the right DLPFC, IPL, and TPJ, the left IFG (AIFO), the right PMC, and FEF were associated with response inhibition. These structures were repeatedly found to be activated whenever the condition of equal probability presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli was compared with the control Go condition (\u201c50/50% Go/NoGo blocks\u2009>\u2009100% Go-control blocks\u201d contrast). At the same time, we did not observe the selective response inhibition effect (\u201cNoGo\u2009>\u2009Go\u201d) in the current study. This finding is consistent with the data of several previous event-related fMRI studies that did not find significant activity increase in NoGo trials compared to Go trials under similar experimental conditions , see also random-effects analysis within visual and audio modalities in . \n\nAn important question is whether we did not able to observe selective response inhibition due to insufficient inhibitory load in our task setting. Previously, it was argued that some configurations of the Go/NoGo task may not reliably evoke prepotent motor activity and therefore their inhibition requirements are reduced . The argument for this was supported by fronto-central P300 amplitude reduction observed in the slow-paced (i.e. stimulus-stimulus interval\u2009>\u20094\u00a0s) equiprobable Go/NoGo settings compared to settings with fast-paced rare NoGo trials. However, the study by Wessel  did not consider the cue-target type paradigms, aimed to increase the likelihood of a prepotent motor response, as in the current study. Equiprobable cue-target Go/NoGo tasks have previously been successfully used to study prepotent response inhibition . Moreover, the Wessel study  considered fronto-central P300 as an index of inhibition of prepotent motor activity. However, some studies have suggested that the P300 component (and also the N200 component) is too late to explain the inhibition processes . It was argued that a marker of inhibitory control should exhibit activity that precedes inhibitory effects at the level of the motor cortex or the effector muscles (about 150\u00a0ms after inhibitory stimuli presentation, see . \n\nArguments on fast early inhibition were considered in a recent review by Diesburg and Wessel  developing the \u201cPause-then-Cancel\u201d model of motor inhibition in humans. This model was originally proposed by Schmidt and Berke  based on subcortical rodent recordings. It assumes that inhibition of motor responses is a two-stage mechanism. In the first stage, any unexpected stimuli non-selectively and briefly delay or \u201cPause\u201d actions. The \u201cPause\u201d process has a global inhibitory effect on the motor system via the monosynaptic \u201chyperdirect\u201d pathway from the cortex to the subthalamic nucleus and is similar to the \u201cglobal inhibition\u201d concept proposed by Frank . In the second stage, if an unexpected stimulus is discriminated as inhibitory, a relatively slower inhibitory process fully \u201cCancels\u201d action via the \u201cindirect\u201d pathway. Therefore, the \u201cPause\u201d process \u201cbuys time\u201d for stimulus discrimination and decision making. According to the \u201cPause-then-Cancel\u201d model, the early transient suppression of corticospinal excitability and subthreshold EMG may be a reflection of the \u201cPause\u201d process. Although Diesburg and Wessel  have mainly focused on the stop-signal tasks, they also argued that their theoretical framework applies to motor inhibition in other paradigms, including the Go/NoGo tasks. The authors posit that the \u201cPause\u201d process is part of a universal orienting response common to all salient, task-relevant events. This is in line with the hypothesis of the current study. When the context is uncertain because of the equiprobable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli, any imperative Go or NoGo stimuli may non-selectively trigger the inhibitory process. Conceptually this is similar to the \u201cPause\u201d process. \n\nThe presence of the prepotent response tendency in the current study was supported both by fast response times (\u2053\u2009380\u00a0ms) and increased LBR in NoGo trials compared to Ignore trials (fee Fig.\u00a0 ), in which no prepotent motor activity was expected. The former finding is closely match behavioural data from previous studies with similar equiprobable Go/NoGo design, where subjects were trained to react as fast as possible to create prepotent response tendency . The later experimentally demonstrates the presence of covert prepotent motor activity in NoGo trials. \n\nThe other important question is how precisely observed activity can be associated with response inhibition per se in those brain regions in which the overlap was found between the meta-analysis and Bayesian analysis. It is well known that the frontoparietal structures (DLPFC, IPL, TPJ) are engaged not only in Go/NoGo tasks but also in experiments examining task switching, resolution of cognitive conflicts, working memory, and attention focusing (\u201cmultiple demand system\u201d ; \u201ctask-general network\u201d ; \u201cextrinsic mode network\u201d . According to the \u201cPause-then-Cancel\u201d model the non-selective inhibitory process (\u201cPause\u201d) and attentional process may be indistinguishable, because attentional orienting to salient, task-related signals inherently accompanied by broad motor suppression . Both processes are so fast and transient that their neural signatures may be near impossible to disentangle. Furthermore, attentional and inhibitory processes may rely on overlapping neural circuits. \n\nHowever, several attempts have been made to dissociate inhibitory and attentional processes by using special modifications of Go/NoGo task that control for attentional loads. For example, the fMRI study by Chikazoe et al.  showed greater activation to infrequent NoGo-stimuli than to infrequent Go-stimuli in the right posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG). Since both NoGo and Go stimuli were infrequent, the authors associated pIFG activation with an inhibitory process. They also demonstrated attention-related activity in the right inferior frontal junction (anatomically close to pIFG) using infrequent Go stimuli vs. frequent Go stimuli contrast. The other fMRI study by Dodds et al.  showed activation in the right IFG to NoGo trials without attentional shifting compared to Go trials with attentional shifting. Reverse contrast revealed activation in the left inferior parietal cortex. The authors suggested that the right IFG and the left inferior parietal cortex are preferentially activated during response inhibition and attentional shifting, respectively. Dissimilar results have been observed in the fMRI study by Meffert et al. , which varied the frequency of Go and NoGo stimuli. They showed that the   left   IFG and dorsal pre-SMA were responsive to NoGo stimuli regardless of stimuli frequency. Meanwhile, a more ventral portion of pre-SMA and anterior insula showed greater activity to low frequency relative to higher frequency stimuli, regardless of response type. Finally, in the EEG studies by Hong et al.  and Hong et al.  the attention-related neural activity (P300 ERP and theta oscillations in the cingulate cortex) was dissociated from inhibitory-related activity by comparing between attended-NoGo and ignored-NoGo conditions. \n\nAt the same time, the most prominent feature of brain activity during Go/NoGo tasks compared to diverse non-inhibitory tasks is a right-dominant activity in DLPFC [meta-analyses: ]. Among different response inhibition tasks, several meta-analyses showed that an action-restraint (Go/NoGo task) elicits stronger activation in the right DLPFC and parietal cortex compared to another inhibition process, namely, action cancellation (stop-signal task) . Furthermore, the \u201cresponse uncertainty\u201d tasks induced by the equal probability of Go and NoGo stimuli evoked more activity in the right DLPFC (near the cluster revealed in the current study with coordinates [x\u2009=\u200945 y\u2009=\u200933 z\u2009=\u200928], see Table  ) compared to Go/NoGo and stop-signal tasks with a low probability of inhibitory stimuli (\u201cresponse override\u201d tasks) . \n\nIn meta-analyses by Simmonds et al.  and Criaud and Boulinguez , it was supposed that the increased activity in the right DLPFC observed during Go/NoGo tasks may be due to increased demands caused by working memory and attentional load rather than the inhibition processes per se. The authors explained this by the fact that most of the fMRI studies used complex designs. Therefore, it would be relatively more difficult to identify a NoGo stimulus, which is believed to increase the need for inhibitory control and consequently increase the brain inhibitory activity in NoGo trials. However, this confounding effect was controlled in the current fMRI study because we utilized a simple equiprobable Go/NoGo task. \n\nAnother prefrontal structure related to the non-selective response inhibition in the current study was the left IFG (opercular part, AIFO). At the same time, the right IFG is commonly associated with response inhibition . Based on the study of patients with brain damage  and other neuroimaging studies using primarily the stop-signal tasks , it was claimed that the right IFG represents a key node of the response inhibition brain system. Currently, this opinion is under active discussion . It is noted that Aron et al.  predominantly relied upon studies using the stop-signal task and did not consider studies using Go/NoGo tasks . Other studies revealed worse performance in the Go/NoGo task when the left (not right) IFG was damaged . According to these findings, the left IFG can also participate in inhibitory control during action restraint, which is also confirmed by our results. \n\nRegarding the practically equivalent participation of PMC in both the Go and NoGo trials, it was previously shown to participate in the planning and coordination of actions because its electrical stimulation results in involuntary motor actions . According to Duque et al. , premotor cortex function is associated with inhibition of any premature actions and control of the time of action execution. The authors refer to this brain mechanism as \u201cimpulse control\u201d, a concept that is similar to the non-selective response inhibition . \n\nIn summary, it can be noted that the selectivity of response inhibition has been studied more extensively to date than its non-selectivity. A considerable amount of research on inhibitory control has used tasks with a low probability of inhibitory stimuli. However, over time, it has become apparent that under several conditions, non-selectivity of response inhibition can, in principle, occur. Studies on non-selectivity of response inhibition typically focus on the possible brain mechanisms for non-selective (\u201cglobal\u201d) inhibition of motor responses in the settings of interference among multiple concurrent response options . Recently, Criaud et al.  supposed the possibility of involvement of non-selective response inhibition not only for NoGo stimuli but also for Go stimuli. In the current study, the practical equivalence of BOLD signals evoked by equiprobable NoGo and Go stimuli was demonstrated for a number of brain areas associated with response inhibition in an uncertain context, according to our meta-analysis. The present study results proved that response inhibition can act as a non-selective mechanism of action inhibition when the context is uncertain. Thus, one promising area of further research of brain mechanisms of response inhibition (and inhibitory control in general) is the study of the interplay between selective and non-selective inhibition as a function of the contextual uncertainty degree. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nFor the first time, combining a meta-analysis and second-level Bayesian analysis yielded results favouring the existence of non-selective response inhibition in equiprobable Go/NoGo task settings. In the present work, selectivity means that inhibition is triggered only by an inhibitory stimulus. The overlap between brain areas previously associated with response inhibition in uncertain context and brain areas demonstrating the practical equivalence of neuronal activity in equiprobable Go and NoGo trials was observed in the right DLPFC, IPL, TPJ, FEF, PMC, and left IFG (AIFO). When a subject was waiting for an equiprobable Go or NoGo stimulus, a non-selective inhibitory control process occurred in both Go trials and NoGo trials in opposition to the model of selective response inhibition. This type of response inhibition prevents the performance of any premature motor actions and operates in a non-selective, \u201cglobal\u201d mode. Its involvement is favoured by contextual uncertainty caused by the equally probable presentation of Go and NoGo stimuli. Presumably, upon the identification of a Go stimulus, the inhibition is released and the process of action execution is initiated, i.e., it acts as a gating mechanism for accessing a prepared motor program. At the same time, we do not discard the opportunity of involvement of selective inhibitory mechanisms in a less uncertain context. Therefore, future research should address the issue of how brain mechanisms of selective and non-selective response inhibition are inter-related. \n\n### Limitations and further considerations \n  \nGenerally, it is assumed that the non-selective response inhibition is a relatively early transient process. Therefore, one of the limitations is associated with a low temporal resolution of the fMRI method. Further studies of the early temporal dynamics of neural activity are needed using EEG, MEG, and intracranial recordings in similar uncertain context settings. In particular, evidence for the practical equivalence of early ERP amplitudes (170\u00a0ms) revealed previously in equiprobable NoGo and Go trials should be provided in a future research. It is also important to note that we looked for practically equivalent increases in regional brain activity as measured by BOLD-signal. Firstly, it is possible to look for the similarity of local activity patterns by employing multivariate classification techniques in future studies. Secondly, future research should consider how non-selective response inhibition is mediated by interactions between the revealed cortical structures and subcortical structures that form inhibitory and excitatory cortico-striato-thalamo cortical circuits. \n\nDespite the fact that revealed fast reaction times and the LBR increase in NoGo trials evidenced the existence of prepotent response tendency, the low error rate might be a potential limitation of the current study because of the high automaticity of induced behaviour. At the same time, such low commission error rates have been repeatedly reported in several equiprobable Go/NoGo studies . Future research should use objective electrophysiological measures, such as LRPs, subthreshold electromyographic activity, and motor evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation to rigorously demonstrate prepotent motor activity in equiprobable cue-target Go/NoGo task settings. \n\nThe other important challenge for the current study and the field in general is the question of segregation of the brain activity elicited by non-selective response inhibition from that elicited by non-inhibitory processes, like attentional or executive processes. One possible solution may be to look for brain activity that is causally related to inhibitory effects at the level of the primary motor cortex, spinal cord, and effector muscles. \n\n\n\n## Supplementary Information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9203582, "text_md5": "a525b7315c80fa7d96613f228ae28709", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 85], "journal": [86, 93], "publication_year": [95, 99], "title": [110, 248], "keywords": [262, 299], "abstract": [312, 2227], "body": [2236, 62192]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35710930, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-022-14221-x", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9203582", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9203582"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9203582\">9203582</a>", "list_title": "PMC9203582  Evidence for non-selective response inhibition in uncertain contexts revealed by combined meta-analysis and Bayesian analysis of fMRI data"}

However, many of these studies report the activation of varying motor system areas that include the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, dorsal and ventral pre-motor areas and parietal regions. In order to examine what specific roles are played by various motor regions during music perception, we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to conduct a meta-analysis of neuroimaging literature on passive music listening. After extensive search of the literature, 42 studies were analyzed resulting in a total of 386 unique subjects contributing 694 activation foci in total. As suspected, auditory activations were found in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, transverse temporal gyrus, insula, pyramis, bilateral precentral gyrus, and bilateral medial frontal gyrus. We also saw the widespread activation of motor networks including left and right lateral premotor cortex, right primary motor cortex, and the left cerebellum. These results suggest a central role of the motor system in music and rhythm perception. We discuss these findings in the context of the Action Simulation for Auditory Prediction (ASAP) model and other predictive coding accounts of brain function. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn the case of (most) music, we do not merely passively receive temporal patterns, but actively engage with the sound stream by discerning an underlying periodicity. This profound shaping of temporal perception is central to understanding and participation in music, dance and even speech/conversation. In recent years, neuroimaging studies have shown that passively listening to music activates brain regions that reside in the motor system proper. The same neural correlates underlying the creation of music and moving to music appear to be involved even when one is only listening to a musical piece [ \u2013 ]. \n\nThe motor system has received increasing attention in non-purely-motor domains [ \u2013 ]. Activity in motor regions during perception of human actions and language is ubiquitous. In early theories of cognitive processing, motor processes and perceptual processes were understood as entirely separate and encapsulated mechanisms [ ]. As evidence accumulates that shows this is not the case and there is substantial overlap among the domains, theories of action production and action perception must be informed accordingly. More recent proposals argue for common coding of perceptual and motor information [ ,  ] that arises primarily due to the co-activation of perceptual and motor components of a given action. Anderson\u2019s [ ] theory of neural reuse additionally suggests that we should expect newly evolved functions such as language to make use of previously instantiated neural mechanisms whose computational functionality can be co-adapted for new purposes. As such, it is likely that motor activation observed during speech perception, for instance, corresponds to a sharing of computational or functional resources for perception and production of a given speech sound. We can expect a similar sharing of resources for music production and music perception as well. \n\nPatel and Iversen [ ] advanced a theory of motor activation during music perception called the ASAP (Action Simulation for Auditory Prediction) hypothesis. The theory suggests that the same neural underpinnings involved in the simulation of body movements are utilized by the motor planning system to entrain neural activation with musical beat. This entrainment allows simulations to be used online during music listening as a predictive sensory signal for the upcoming music beat. The simulation is not tied to a particular effector-based movement, but a simulation of a timed, rhythmic motion. Patel and Iversen suggest the dorsal auditory stream as a potential underlying neural pathway for this process [ ]. \n\nRauschecker [ ] has also proposed that a unified function of the dorsal stream may be anticipatory control of sensorimotor events. In particular, he suggests the posterior superior temporal (ST) regions, along with the inferior parietal lobe (IPL), interface extensively with PMC, linking the motor and auditory regions to established sensorimotor networks for audiomotor processes, such as speech and music. This network is established through similar mechanisms to those used in motor control theories [ ,  ], where a feed-forward projection carrying an efference copy of a motor command is used as a prediction of the upcoming sensory consequences, which can then be compared with the actual sensory outcome of the motor act. Rauschecker proposes that the projection from inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) to vPMC is a likely candidate for carrying an efference copy, while IPL to posterior ST would carry an \u201cafference\u201d copy of the predicted motor signal, thus allowing a continuous audiomotor predictive loop underlying smooth perceptuomotor abilities. \n\nAnother candidate theory, suggested by Schubotz [ ], is of active sensory prediction of events using the motor system. Schubotz extends the idea of emulators from motor control theory to encompass inanimate event perception in addition to human action prediction. Schubotz suggests the following: when we repeatedly hear a melody, the lateral PMC builds up sensorimotor representations using input from association areas of the cortex. These sensorimotor representations are only audiomotor, lacking the proprioceptive-motor representations that are involved in an actual performed movement. The lateral PMC eventually establishes an internal model of this melody which can be used for perceptual prediction. This internal model is similar to that involved in motor control, but with the components for movement and sensory feedback removed. Schubotz proposes what she calls the HAPEM (Habitual Pragmatic Event Map) framework, which states that \u201cthe prediction of an event that is structured with regard to a property P engages the area of the lateral premotor cortex that is best adapted to specify its motor output in terms of property P\u201d. What this means is that the perception of events with different properties recruits particular somatotopic regions of vPMC, selected based on similarity to the underlying properties of that area of vPMC. For instance, the regions of vPMC that correspond to executing and observing mouth movements are recruited for the perception of rhythmic events, due to the underlying rhythmic nature of the vocal system. \n\nThe above theories all posit that cortical motor areas play a role in music listening. Another emerging theme is that of the motor system having a predictive role in perceptual processes. These accounts are primarily in agreement in terms of which sub-areas in the motor system are involved. Schubotz\u2019s framework directly proposes involvement of both lateral PMC and pre-SMA/SMA, while ASAP and Rauschecker\u2019s theory both set the dorsal auditory stream (which includes dPMC) as the primary substrate. However, activated regions within the motor system measured by neuroimaging methods tend to vary between research studies. For instance, numerous music listening experiments report motor activity in both supplemental motor area (SMA) and dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) [ \u2013  ]. Among these studies, a few show neural activations in cerebellum [ ,  ,  ] or primary motor cortex (M1) [ ] during a music listening task. Said differently, most music-listening studies do not show activation in every region of the motor system, nor do they show uniform activation in any one part of the motor system. In order to gain insight into the functional contribution of the motor system to passive music perception, one necessary step is to determine which motor regions are consistently contributing across music listening instances. \n\nThere are many factors likely to contribute to differences across studies, as each individual experiment has its own musical stimuli that vary in terms of particular characteristics, such as rhythmicity, familiarity, and valence of the music, for instance. Stimuli consisting of highly regular rhythmic structure might engage brain regions important for timing and sequential structure (i.e., supplementary and pre-supplementary motor areas and the cerebellum), while others might not. Experiments also vary in terms of what a participant is directed to focus on in these paradigms, ranging from complete passive listening (not attending) to judging beat or other characteristics of the stimuli. Such task demands are also likely to influence which regions are active, as directing attention to a stimulus may encourage focusing on particular aspects of the music, such as its beat or rhythmicity. In the present study, we are interested in discovering what motor regions are engaged during all music perception\u2014those activated during passive listening. We define passive listening as attentive listening while remaining still (i.e., not tapping along to the music). \n\nIdentifying which regions are active consistently across all music listening tasks would help gain insight into the underlying processes and hone existing theories. Many theories outlining the functional contribution of individual motor areas exist, which can be used to determine what particular function is being carried out in a task utilizing that motor region. If one critical component is the dorsal auditory stream, which has a proposed role in motor planning and mapping auditory information onto potential motor acts, we should observe observation in dPMC [ ,  ]. If activation is found in vPMC, the underlying mechanism might be similar to that proposed in the action observation network, which is responsible for mirror system activity for observed and produced actions [ ,  ,  ]. Many studies that involve music with beat manipulation report activity in SMA and pre-SMA regions, which are presumed to be important for sequential processing of action-related stimuli and for inhibition of movements, respectively [ ,  ]. Thus, SMA activity might indicate processing of sequential aspects of the music, and pre-SMA the inhibition of the natural tendency to move or sway to the music. We also might observe activation of structures in the basal ganglia, which appear to be involved in beat perception [ ]. The basal ganglia are important for movement timing and sequential movement execution [ ,  ]. M1 activation corresponds to particular motor commands that are carried out by specific muscle groups [ ] and has also been found active during observation of actions [ ,  ,  ]. Finally, the cerebellum is known for its crucial role in motor timing and coordination. Research on sensorimotor adaptation has long focused on the role of the cerebellum in predicting sensory consequences of movement and adapting to errors in these predictions (for a more interactive view see [ ,  ,  ,  ]). Furthermore, cerebellar activation in conjunction with hippocampal activity is thought to underlie spatiotemporal prediction of movements [ ]. This implication in predictive processes of motor control might extend to imagined and simulated motor computations, e.g. the cerebellum might be active in musical prediction even when no direct motor control is required. \n\nIn order to determine which of these regions show reliable and consistent activation during music perception, we employed a meta-analysis of all neuroimaging experiments consisting of music listening using an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) [ ]. We predict that from this meta-analysis will emerge a pattern of activation that will enlighten and instruct future theories aiming to explain the motor-specific contributions to passive music perception. Activation of any of the motor regions will provide conclusive evidence for the involvement of the regions of the brain typically considered \u201caction areas\u201d, in the perceptual domain of passive music listening. This will inform theories about what roles are played by the traditional motor system. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nMeta-analyses provide a formal, statistical integration to combine the results of several studies that address a set of related research questions. There are several methods available for the meta-analysis of neuroimaging data and careful consideration was given as to which was most appropriate for this study. First, our study aims were to synthesize neuroimaging data of studies comparing rest and passive listening. More specifically, we wanted to identify regions of consistent activation across studies. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis [ ] addresses this by treating the spatial relationship between within study foci as fixed effects and between study relationships as random effects. Secondly, we considered the characteristics of our dataset. Unlike some other methods (e.g., KDA and MKDA), ALE uses a Gaussian kernel. When several distinct foci are located within the same general area, the Gaussian kernel is most likely to recover the separate foci. And, in general, if the spatial error on peak locations is approximately Gaussian (a reasonable assumption), then the Gaussian kernel will likely yield the most sensitive results. To investigate our research questions, we conducted ALE meta-analysis. Imaging studies commonly report brain locations of task-induced activations as coordinates in 3D space (x,y, and z). ALE meta-analysis techniques can be used to identify reliable activation patterns in 3D space across studies. ALE is a coordinate-based approach to a meta-analysis, allowing researchers to integrate imaging data. Studies are collected, coded and interpreted using analytical methods to assess likelihood of activation through agreement or overlap in activation patterns. \n\nTo perform the ALE meta-analysis, we began by first locating relevant studies. Relevant studies were those that utilized functional brain imaging of healthy subjects listening tasks. We conducted literature searches in Medline and the BrainMap database [ ] using a combination of the following: (1) a functional brain imaging modality, including positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and (2) relevant adjectives related to auditory stimuli. For example, a single search consisted of \u201cImaging\u201d AND \u201cpassive listening\u201d OR \u201cfMRI or functional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d AND \u201cauditory\u201d. The literature search of Medline was performed February 2016 and returned 132,294 papers. The literature search of BrainMap was performed September 14, 2016 and returned 244 studies. To ensure our ability to investigate the specified research questions a subsequent study selection process was done by applying the following inclusion criteria to the studies: (1) subjects were healthy adult participants; (2) The analyses include contrasts against rest or a suitable low-level control condition; (3) peak coordinates of group-level activations were reported; (4) foci activation were available in the form of standardized stereotaxic coordinates in either Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space; (5) that results from the entire scanned volume were reported; and (6) data were available as of September 2016. An effort was made to obtain unreported coordinates from selected studies meeting all other criteria, however, this effort did not return any results. The subsequent review process was performed in two phases. First, an automated review of study titles was done using the R environment (R Development Core Team, 2008) to remove studies that were not in healthy human subject populations. The automated review removed 8144 papers from the database. Next, reviewers read the abstract and/or methods sections of remaining studies to assess appropriateness using the above inclusion criteria.   illustrates the full review process for the meta-analysis. The process yielded 42 experiments that met the criteria for inclusion. A full list of experiments included can be found in  . Experiments included a total of 386 unique subjects, approximately 195 male and 171 female. \n   Flow diagram of study review.       A list of the studies and experiments that were part of our meta-analysis.        \nCoordinates (X, Y, Z) for selected studies were recorded and, where necessary, transformed to Talairach space. Coordinates from individual studies were transferred to a text file formatted for analysis in GingerALE 2.3.6 ( ; Research Imaging Center, University of Texas, San Antonio, TX). These were transferred either using brainmap\u2019s Sleuth software (if the studies were located in the brainmap database), which outputs coordinates in the correct format for GingerALE, or were transferred individually by hand. The ALE meta-analysis was carried out in GingerALE. The ALE procedure was as follows: (1) model of single-study activation foci as peaks of three-dimensional Gaussian probability densities with subject-based full-width at half-maximum values [ ]; (2) summation of probability densities to produce a statistical map estimating the likelihood of activation at each voxel; (3) thresholding of this ALE map based on the null hypothesis of a uniform distribution of foci; (4) correcting for multiple comparisons by family-wise error thresholding. Resulting statistical maps show clusters where convergence between foci is greater than would be expected by chance. Statistical maps were thresholded using cluster-level family-wise error correction P<0.05 (cluster-forming threshold voxel-level P<0.001). \n\nWe split the data into separate studies that used either musicians only or nonmusicians only, with the intention of performing a contrast analysis between the two groups. Unfortunately, there were too few studies in these groups individually (14 experiments in each group), so we were unable to complete this contrast. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n shows the activations during passive listening, demonstrating the common brain network underlying music perception. Talairach coordinates for these ALE foci are presented in  . Activations were seen in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus, transverse temporal gyrus, insula, pyramis, bilateral precentral gyrus, and bilateral medial frontal gyrus. As shown in  , there was activation in the left and right premotor cortex (BA 6), right primary motor cortex (BA 4), and the left cerebellum. \n   Significant clusters from meta-analysis of passive listening tasks in healthy volunteers (family-wise error correction (P<0.05)).  \nThe 3D brain is shown to indicate slice levels. \n     Talairach coordinates for voxel clusters.        \nAn inspection of   reveals that Cluster 1 is centered over the right primary auditory cortex, and spans from BA 22 and BA 41/42 (primary and secondary auditory cortices) in the right hemisphere to BA 6 (right premotor cortex).

Finally, cluster 4 is located in the left cerebellum.   depicts the activation patterns seen bilaterally for a range of   z   values. \n   Contributing foci and study making up each voxel cluster.      \n\n## Discussion \n  \nWe found evidence for consistent activation of various regions of the brain during passive music listening. As expected, our results showed activation in the primary and secondary auditory areas bilaterally. This is consistent with the existing literature showing that these areas are the critical regions of cortex for processing incoming auditory information [ ]. Other activated areas included both right primary motor cortex, right and left lateral premotor cortex, and left cerebellum. We discuss in turn the implications for each of these findings below. \n\n### Activation of premotor cortex \n  \nWe were unable to pinpoint activation to any further subregions of lateral PMC (i.e., dorsal or ventral), as the activation pattern could be consistent with either dorsal or ventral PMC. The average coordinates for these regions overlap in such a way that neither can be ruled out. This means that premotor involvement could be via dorsal, ventral, or both. The activation of PMC in the present analysis is consistent with both ASAP and the HAPEM framework. However, because we do not know whether this activation is localized to ventral or dorsal PMC, it is unclear if this activity reflects involvement of the dorsal stream, or potentially the action observation network that recruits vPMC for action simulation. Also, given that these clusters only represent aggregate BOLD activation, we do not have insight into the temporal dynamics of this activity, which will be crucial for inference about its origin. \n\n\n### Activation of primary motor cortex \n  \nM1 activity could reflect either an excitatory or inhibitory contribution, as the BOLD signal does not differentiate the two. Vigneswaran et al. [ ] report that while many M1 neurons are active during action observation and thus classified as mirror neurons [ ], M1 neurons directly connecting to spinal circuitry and thus contributing to observed action are suppressed during the observation of action, in order to prevent explicit action. Simulative properties of mirror neurons have also been confirmed in response to auditory sounds [ ]. Thus, either excitatory, inhibitory, or both could give rise to activation of M1 during passive music listening. Some theories of mirror neuron activity [ ] additionally claim that the mirror neuron network uses active inference during the perception of observed actions using predictive mechanisms. \n\nFurther examination of the studies that contributed to the right premotor/primary motor activation cluster reveals that a number of them used tasks that were not passive listening in the same way as passive background listening. For example, Chen et al. [ ] required in some experimental conditions for participants to anticipate later tapping to the beat in subsequent trials, which may recruit motor planning regions during the listening task. Grahn and Brett [ ] asked their participants to determine whether the rhythms of two stimuli were the same or different, which may recruit motor areas to assist with the detection task. Finally, Tsai et al. [ ] asked participants in some of their tasks to covertly hum along with the music that they were hearing, which may recruit motor areas for subvocalization. Therefore, more work should be done to decisively conclude whether motor areas are recruiting during background listening, in addition to passively listening for properties of the music while remaining still. \n\n\n### Activation of cerebellum \n  \nMany studies contributed to the cluster indicating left cerebellum. The activation of PMC and cerebellum during music listening supports predictive theories of the motor system, such that the cerebellum might provide the predictive component in a forward model of the upcoming sensory consequences. The cerebellum may be providing an inverse model for mapping sensory input to the simulated movement that would give rise to that sensation. An investigation of the temporal dynamics of communication among these regions can again provide further insight into the mechanism. \n\n\n### Lack of activation in SMA/pre-SMA and basal ganglia structures \n  \nWhile quite a few studies did report activation of SMA and pre-SMA, we did not find corresponding activation in our meta-analysis. We also failed to find evidence of basal ganglia activation. One potential reason for this discrepancy may be that another process on top of passive listening is needed to engage these regions. The generally agreed upon roles of both SMA and the basal ganglia are of sequential learning and timing [ ,  ,  ]. Because these are properties of the majority of music, this region is likely to be recruited in many musical contexts. However, without directly listening for these properties of the music, it appears that automatic SMA and basal ganglia activation is not prevalent. Looking more closely at those experiments that explicitly report SMA/pre-SMA activation, they do appear to have a musical beat component to them, which relies on the underlying sequential and timing properties of the music. Bengtsson et al [ ] encouraged participants to focus on rhythmic properties of the music, as did Chen, Penhume and Zatorre [ ] and Grahn and Brett [ ]. Baumann et al. [ ] required subjects to do a counting task during passive listening as a distractor, which may have resulted in SMA activation. Experiments showing basal ganglia activation also appear to involve a beat detection task [ ]. \n\nIt also may be the case that activation of SMA/pre-SMA is only prevalent in musically-trained individuals, who are more likely to attend to and perceive the structural aspects of the music due to their background training. Baumann et al. [ ] report increased activation of both pre-SMA and SMA in musicians compared to nonmusicians, as did Bangert [ ] for SMA activation. Participants in Meister et at [ ] showing SMA activation were all musicians. Thus, it appears SMA activation is likely due to either a trained musical background and/or a focus on the rhythmic properties of music. \n\nThese results show that the passive perception of music engages a large and complex network of brain regions. This includes activation of areas in the motor system proper. Activation of the cerebellum and primary and premotor cortices suggests that perceived music is partly processed in areas typically considered as important for action-relevant information only. Recruitment of premotor areas during music listening supports many theories of motor involvement during perceptual tasks [ ,  ,  ]. The idea of shared neural resources for tasks with underlying computational similarities has gained recent theoretical and grounded neurobiological support [ ]. Most current theories suggest that perceptual processing involves the same kinds of temporal prediction involved in action, making a shared circuit useful for action-based and perception-based processing. An alternative (or potentially compatible) hypothesis is that involvement of PMC reflects the process of simulation [ ], where the motor system underlies simulation of the actions required to create the observed sensory information. Our findings are consistent with both of these theoretical frameworks, though it does not provide any insight for distinguishing which theory best fits the data, as this meta-analysis only tells us which areas are active at some point in the process. This work supports the currently merging conceptualizations of action and perception [ ,  ]. \n\nOne limitation of the present meta-analysis was that we were unable to obtain data from contacted authors for studies that did not report all of the observed brain activations. It is possible that unpublished or unreported activations may have biased our results toward reporting motor and auditory areas, as studies that do not find activation in these areas of interest are less likely to be reported. This inability to obtain unavailable data also likely contributed to our inability to obtain enough studies for the musician/nonmusician contrast. Further exploration of differential activation in musicians relative to nonmusicians is important for advancing this work. Musicians exhibit plasticity-induced changes perceptual and motor abilities, as well as changes in structural and functional neuronal connectivity [ \u2013 ]. In particular, we believe that musicians passively listening to music should also recruit supplementary motor cortex, and might show greater activation of the cerebellum, which has a larger volume in musicians [ ]. Another interesting avenue to pursue is to run more studies that directly compare different types of music listening tasks. For instance, we might compare background listening to listening in anticipation of some movement to listening for particular musical features, such as rhythm or grooviness. This will incorporate context-dependent music listening, which may reveal that different (but likely highly overlapping) networks are recruited in separate contexts. An additional limitation of this approach is that while we can identify which brain areas are active at some point during the music listening task, the BOLD signal cannot tell us anything about the temporal dynamics of the process. Complementary methods, such as EEG, should be used along with imaging data to investigate the functional connectivity among these music listening networks. This will also allow us to determine which of the existing theories fit best with the data. \n\nIn summary, this study adds support to the idea that motor planning activity serves not only to help us move but is recruited for music perception even in the absence of movement. Further exploration will elucidate the functional purpose of this recruitment, as well as why and how different music listening contexts seem to engage slightly different networks. An understanding of the auditory-motor interactions underlying music perception could explain a growing number of findings suggesting an important link between music perception and the action systems of the brain. \n\n\n\n## Supporting information \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6242316, "text_md5": "d827d4959ca635278440ab1e660457da", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 67], "journal": [68, 76], "publication_year": [78, 82], "title": [93, 182], "keywords": [196, 196], "abstract": [209, 1564], "body": [1573, 29772]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30452442, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0207213", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6242316", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6242316"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6242316\">6242316</a>", "list_title": "PMC6242316  Recruitment of the motor system during music listening: An ALE meta-analysis of fMRI data"}

By following the PRISMA checklist, the quality assessment of included studies was performed, the true positive and negative values (TP and TN), false positive and negative values (FP and FN), and general characteristics of all the included studies were extracted. Results of PET consistent with reference standard were defined as TP or TN. The pooled sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves (HSROC) were generated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. \n\n Results:   The 33 included studies had 1,734 patients with 1,811 lesions suspected of glioma recurrence. Fifteen studies tested the accuracy of  F-FET PET, 12 tested  F-FDG PET, seven tested  C-MET PET, and three tested  F-DOPA PET.  F-FET PET showed a pooled Sen and Spe of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.93) and 0.78 (0.69, 0.85), respectively. In the subgroup analysis of FET-PET, diagnostic accuracy of high-grade gliomas (HGGs) was higher than that of mixed-grade gliomas (  P   = 0.04).  F-FDG PET showed a pooled Sen and Spe of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.83) and 0.87 (0.80, 0.92), the Spe of the HGGs group was lower than that of the low-grade gliomas group (0.82 vs. 0.90,   P   = 0.02).  C-MET PET had a pooled Sen and Spe of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.96) and 0.78 (0.69, 0.86).  F-DOPA PET had a pooled Sen and Spe of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.89) and 0.70 (0.60, 0.79). FET-PET combined with MRI had a pooled Sen and Spe of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.94) and 0.76 (0.57, 0.88). Multi-parameters analysis of FET-PET had pooled Sen and Spe values of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.92) and 0.79 (0.63, 0.89). \n\n Conclusion:   PET has a moderate diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between TPR and PTRC. The high Sen of amino acid PET and high Spe of FDG-PET suggest that the combination of commonly used FET-PET and FDG-PET may be more accurate and promising, especially for low-grade glioma. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nGlioma is the most common primary brain tumor. It includes low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and high-grade gliomas (HGGs). The annual incidence of gliomas is approximately six cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide ( ). Maximizing extent of resection (EOR) was demonstrated to be associated with improved outcomes, including progression-free survival and overall survival, by multiple retrospective analyses ( ,  ). According to the NCCN guidelines, the standard treatment method for LGGs is surgical gross total resection combined with radiotherapy (RT) and adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) of temozolomide (TMZ) or PCV (procarbazine, lomustine, vincristine); for HGGs it is total resection followed by concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy of TMZ or PCV (more than six cycles) ( \u2013 ). \n\nTumor progression monitoring is very important for patients with glioma after treatment. A confirmed diagnosis of tumor recurrence or progression guides surgeon and patients for the next treatment strategy. Progression and recurrence can be described as true glioma progression (TPR), while all treatment effects can (e.g., radiation necrosis and pseudoprogression) be described as post treatment-related change (PTRC). The wrong differentiation between TPR and PTRC will cause the wrong decision to be made by surgeon and patients, for example an unnecessary secondary surgery or the best surgery opportunity missed. Assessment of the glioma treatment response to differentiate between PTRC and TPR remains as much of a challenge as the treatment ( ,  ). \n\nAt present, imaging follow-up was still the most common method to monitor TPR. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (G-T1-MRI) is often the choice for monitoring glioma patients' response to PTRC and TPR. However, this test often gets a false positive result because it only detects the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and not the tumor activity specifically. To overcome the limitations of G-T1-MRI, multimodal MRI has been proposed, including magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), among others ( ,  ). Some previous meta-analyses had demonstrated the relative high diagnostic accuracy of MRS and PWI but low accuracy of DWI ( \u2013 ). However, these methods also sometimes caused false positive or false negative results because of their inability to provide metabolic information of lesions directly. \n\nDue to the challenge to accurately determine brain tumor response by MRI both in daily practice and clinical trials, radiolabeled amino acid-positron emission tomography (PET) was proposed in the management of brain tumors by the RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology) group ( ). The radiotracers include O-(2-[ F] fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ( F-FET),  F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( F-FDG),  C-methionine ( C-MET), 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-l-phenylalanine ( F-DOPA), and  C-choline ( C-CHO), among others. PET of various tracers can visualize biological processes such as cell proliferation, membrane biosynthesis, glucose consumption, and uptake of amino acid analogs. Hence PET provides additional insight beyond MRI into the biology and treatment response of gliomas which may be used for non-invasive grading, differential diagnosis, delineation of tumor extent, surgical and radiotherapy treatment planning, post treatment surveillance, and prognostication ( ). Many previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of PET for the assessment of the treatment response of glioma ( ,  ), yet a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of PET using different radiotracers and parameters is lacking. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of PET at differentiating TPR and PTRC. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search Strategy \n  \nThis systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) criteria ( ). It was registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42020197852. PubMed and Embase were searched using the key words as follows: \u201cglioma\u201d or \u201cglioblastoma\u201d or \u201castrocytoma\u201d or \u201coligodendroglioma\u201d or \u201coligoastrocytoma\u201d; and \u201cPositron Emission Tomography\u201d or \u201cPET;\u201d and \u201cprogression\u201d or \u201crecurrence\u201d or \u201crecurrent\u201d or \u201crelapse\u201d or \u201cpseudoprogression\u201d or \u201cnecrosis\u201d or \u201cposttreatment.\u201d The detailed search strategy is shown in  . \n\n\n### Selection Criteria \n  \nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: English language, publication from January 1999 to December 2019, clinical diagnostic test for glioma with adequate PET data (radiotracers, imaging technique, parameters, etc.), more than 15 patients, adult patients with glioma treated with standard therapy (surgery+RT/CT), diagnostic test involving PET to differentiate between TPR and PTRC compared to a definite reference standard diagnosis (histology or clinical/imaging follow-up), and 2 \u00d7 2 tables from which true positives (TP), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true negatives (TN) could be extracted. The reference standard of clinical/imaging follow-up was reasonable according to RANO criteria. For WHO grade II gliomas, the PTRC required that both the clinical and the radiological situation had to be stable/improved for at least 12 months without administration of another therapy. For WHO grade III-IV gliomas, the classification of PTRC required at least 6 months of stable or improved clinical and radiological condition, as well as no change in tumor treatment. TPR was considered present when lesions continued to increase in size on at least two subsequent MRI scans, paralleled by a deterioration in performance status, or when a patient died of glioma, which ever occurred first ( ). \n\nExclusion criteria were the inclusion of other tumor entities besides glioma (such as brain metastases, lymphomas, or meningiomas); pediatric glioma patients;   in vitro   or animal studies; publication as a review, letter, comment, case report, or abstract; and treatment methods other than standard therapy recommended by NCCN guidelines ( ), such as antiangiogenic bevacizumab therapy, intracavitary radiation, and tumor-treating field therapy. \n\n\n### Data Extraction and Quality Assessment \n  \nAfter duplicates were eliminated, studies were screened for eligibility based first on their title and abstract and subsequently on their full text independently by a board-certified neurosurgeon with 6 years of experience and a neuro-oncologist with 5 years of experience. Study quality was assessed independently according to the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) ( ). Then these two authors reviewed in detail the abstracts, methods, results, figures, and tables. Extracted data consisted of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN); if raw numbers were not reported in the papers, we calculated them from the sensitivity (Sen) and specificity (Spe). The general characteristics extracted from each study were the total number of patients, study design, patient selection criteria, therapy method, mean or median age, sex, reference standard of diagnosis (histopathology or clinical/MRI follow-up), time point at which tumor progression was suspected, PET characteristics and time at which PET was performed, and parameters of PET with or without cut-off value. Disagreements were reassessed by the two authors together to reach a consensus. \n\n\n### Statistical Analysis \n  \nBy using Meta-Disc statistical software version 1.4, we first evaluated the heterogeneity between each study caused by the threshold effect. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the logit of Sen and the logit of (1\u2013Spe) was computed to assess the threshold effect ( ). A strong positive correlation would suggest a threshold effect with   P   < 0.05. \n\nThen, we used Stata 14.0 to perform the statistical analysis: (1) To evaluate the extent of heterogeneity in each study, we used the Q test and the inconsistency index (  I  ) of the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR: the ratio of LR+ and LR-). Heterogeneity was considered to be significant if   P   < 0.1 or   I   > 50%. In this case, the Sen and Spe of the studies were pooled using a random-effects model. Otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used ( ). (2) The pooled Sen, Spe, and DOR with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all studies and are presented as forest plots. If any cells of studies contained a count of zero, a value of one was added to replace zero in order to avoid any impossibilities in odds calculations for studies with a Sen or Spe of 100%. (3) The hierarchical logistic regression model was used to generate hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy ( \u2013 ). (4) We assessed publication bias visually by using a scatter plot (X axis was log DOR, Y axis was ESS , which is the inverse of the square root of effective sample size). A symmetric funnel shape and   P   > 0.01 in Deeks' asymmetry test indicated the absence of publication bias; otherwise, there was significant bias. \n\nSubgroup analysis was performed using meta-regression if \u22653 studies could be included, and meta-regression tests were used to analyze differences between subgroups. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Characteristics of Included Studies \n  \nA flow diagram describing our study search process is provided in  . The results of the quality assessment are presented in   and  . In brief, the quality of the included studies was satisfactory. \n  \nFlow diagram of the study-screening process. \n    \nMethodological quality assessment summary of the included studies. \n  \nIn total, the 33 included studies (retrospective = 21, prospective = 12) consisted of 1,734 patients and 1,811 lesions suspected of glioma recurrence. The mean ages ranged from 33.9 to 59.5 years. There were 1,110 males and 624 females. The lesions comprised 388 (21.4%) LGGs (WHO grades I and II) and 1,300 (71.8%) HGGs (WHO grades III and IV). In addition, 16 (0.9%) were other kinds of brain tumors, and 107 (5.9%) pathology results of lesions were not mentioned or determined. \n\nAmong the included studies, 15 tested the accuracy of  F-FET PET ( \u2013 ), 12 tested  F-FDG PET ( \u2013 ), seven tested  C-MET PET ( ,  ,  \u2013 ), three tested  F-DOPA PET ( ,  ,  ), one tested  F-FLT PET ( ), and 1 tested  C-CHO PET ( ). Of all the included lesions, 836 (46.0%) had histopathology as the reference standard, 549 (30.2%) had clinical combined with imaging follow-up, and 81 (4.5%) only had imaging or clinical follow-up. Though the remaining 353 (19.4%) cases had either a combination or individual use of histopathology and clinical and imaging follow-up as the reference standard, the detailed data were not reported in these four studies ( ,  ,  ,  ). The total incidence of TPR was 77.4% (1,394/1,801) in all patients. The incidence of TPR in HGG and LGG patients was 80.5% (577/717) and 63.1% (106/168), respectively. The incidence of PTRC was 22.6% (407/1,801) among all patients, 19.5% (140/717) in patients with HGG, and 36.9% (62/168) in patients with LGG ( ). \n\n\n### Quantitative Synthesis \n  \nThe pooled results and subgroup analysis are shown in  ,  , respectively.

The Sen of these studies had high heterogeneity (  P   < 0.1,   I   = 85.3%). Subgroup analysis of glioma histopathology showed that the HGG subgroup of the FET-PET test group benefitted from higher accuracy than the mixed-grade group (  P   = 0.04). Subgroup analysis of PET scans (static and dynamic scan groups) showed no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy (  P   = 0.54). Different time points of PET scans may influence the diagnostic accuracy, but subgroup analysis indicated no difference between the \u22647-day and >7-day groups after suspicious recurrence. \n\nThresholds of the tumor-to-brain mean ratio (TBRmean) ranged from 1.52 to 2.98. The Spearman's correlation coefficient (\u03c1) was \u22120.677 (  P   = 0.022), which indicated that a threshold effect was detected only in this group when quantitative synthesis was performed. Therefore, the Sen and Spe of studies could not be pooled directly. The AUC of the HSROC curve was 0.90 (0.87, 0.92), which was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the TBRmean tests of FET-PET. \n\nThe pooled weighted values of time-to-peak (TTP) tests were Sen = 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.88), Spe = 0.67 (0.48, 0.81), DOR = 8 (4, 16), and AUC = 0.81 (0.77, 0.84). \n\n\n#### F-FDG PET \n  \nThe pooled weighted values were Sen = 0.78 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.83), Spe = 0.87 (0.80, 0.92), and DOR = 23 (14, 39). The AUC of the HSROC curve was 0.90 (0.87, 0.92). Subgroup analysis of PET visual assessment and semiquantitative analysis of one parameter (such as TBR and SUV) were performed. The difference in Spe between these two groups was statistically significant (  P   < 0.05). Subgroup analysis of glioma histopathology showed that the mixed-grade group and LGG group had higher pooled Spe than the HGG group according to the FDG-PET test (0.87 vs. 0.82 [  P   < 0.05], 0.90 vs. 0.82 [  P   = 0.02]). However, the pooled Sen of the HGG group was not significantly different from those of the other two groups (both   P   > 0.05). \n\n\n#### C-MET PET (TBR) \n  \nHeterogeneity was detected in pooled Sen (  P   < 0.1,   I   = 86.3%). The pooled Sen, Spe, and DOR were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.96), 0.78 (0.69, 0.86), and 39 (15, 105), respectively. The AUC of the HSROC curve was 0.82 (0.78, 0.85). The subgroup of HGGs and the subgroup of mixed grades were analyzed, but no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy were detected (all   P   > 0.05). Subgroup analysis of time points showed a higher pooled Spe of the >20 months after radiotherapy group than the <20 months group (  P   = 0.04), but the diagnostic accuracy in these two groups was not different (  P   = 0.11). \n\n\n#### F-DOPA PET (TBRmax, Visual) \n  \nThe pooled values of Sen, Spe, and DOR were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.89), 0.70 (0.60, 0.79), and 13 (7, 24), respectively. The AUC of the HSROC curve was 0.85 (0.82, 0.88). Subgroup analysis showed that there were significant differences between the visual and semiquantitative groups regarding sensitivity (  P   < 0.05). \n\n\n\n### Publication Bias Assessment \n  \nPublication bias did not exist in the FET-PET (TBRmax), FDG-PET, or  F-DOPA-PET studies (  P   = 0.85,   P   = 0.99,   P   = 0.40), while bias may have existed in the MET-PET (TBR) studies (  P   = 0.01) ( ). \n  \nFunnel plots of publication bias for different PET tests.

The AUC of the HSROC curve was 0.90 (0.87, 0.92). The multi-parameter FET-PET test had pooled Sen, Spe, DOR, and AUC values of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.92), 0.79 (0.63, 0.89), 26 (9, 78), and 0.91 (0.88, 0.93), respectively. Publication bias did not exist between these studies (  P   = 0.66,   P   = 0.65). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo overcome the limitations of MRI, PET-CT has been suggested by RANO for the management of glioma in addition to conventional MRI at every disease stage ( ). Many studies have explored the diagnostic accuracy of PET labeled by different radiotracers, which indicates its potential value. Static and dynamic PET scans can acquire different parameters to assess diagnosis. Static scans can calculate SUVmax, SUVmean, TBRmax, and TBRmean to analyze the characteristics of radiotracer uptake in lesions and unaffected brain tissue to differentiate between tumor and normal brain tissue. Dynamic scanning brings in the variable of time and can depict the time-activity curves (TACs) of radiotracer uptake by lesions, and can then identify tumors by calculating TTP or slope (the change in SUV per hour) or by visually assessing the shape of TACs ( ,  ,  ). All these parameters are believed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of PET tests compared to visual assessments alone. \n\nAccording to the pooled AUC of HSROC curves in this meta-analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of  FET-PET was similar to that of  F-FDG PET, which was higher than that of  F-DOPA PET and  C-MET PET. \n\nF-FET PET had a high diagnostic accuracy for TBR. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a higher test accuracy for HGGs than gliomas of mixed grades (  P   = 0.04). Because of the higher recurrence rate of HGGs than LGGs, FET-PET will benefit HGG patients more during monitoring recurrence after surgery ( ). Compared with dynamic scanning, static FET-PET scanning may have similar accuracy for the differential diagnosis between TPR and PTRC (  P   = 0.10). \n\nA common PET modality for the central nervous system ( ,  ),  C-MET PET had good test accuracy when calculating TBR (pooled set: 0.92, Spe: 0.78). Although the accuracy of  C-MET PET was not different between the HGG group and the mixed-grade group (  P   = 0.58), a trend of higher diagnostic accuracy in the HGG group was detected. As seen for FET-PET, this result also indicated a better performance of MET-PET for HGG patients.  F-DOPA is a kind of amino acid radiotracer that can be transported across the intact blood-brain barrier, but it is scarcely used or researched ( ). The accuracy of 18F-DOPA PET was not superior to that of FET- or MET-PET in our analysis, which will limit the use of FDOPA-PET. \n\nBecause of the limited number of studies that reported the time when PET was performed, only the FET-PET TBRmax and MET-PET TBR could be evaluated for the influence of time point by subgroup analysis in this review. Because of the pseudoprogression caused by radiotherapy, the symptoms of patients and MRI always showed false positive results, which can be falsely considered as tumor recurrence. In our analysis, a longer time after radiotherapy showed a higher Spe of MET-PET, which indicated that the PET scan may need to be performed in the appropriate time window (perhaps a longer time after radiotherapy). Further research is needed to identify the best time point for performing PET after there is suspicious recurrence on MRI. \n\nF-FDG is a common radiotracer used in PET scans, but it always fails to differentiate between tumors and the brain due to the similarly high uptake rates of glucose in normal brain tissue ( ). In this review, the accuracy of FDG-PET showed a similar accuracy to amino acid PET ( ). Compared to amino acid PET, FDG-PET had a higher Spe but a lower Sen, so we can predict that the combination of these two radiotracers would acquire better diagnostic performance. In the subgroup analysis ( ), the pooled Spe of visual assessment was higher than that of semiquantitative parametric analysis (  P   < 0.05). Compared to the mixed-grade glioma group and LGG group, the HGG group had a lower Spe (  P   < 0.05,   P   = 0.02). These results demonstrate that the high Spe of FDG-PET may be derived from the visual assessment of PET and the testing of LGG patients. Thus, visual assessment should also be an important part of PET tests in addition to parametric analysis. For HGG patients, the accuracy of amino acid PET was satisfactory, while for postoperative recurrence tests of LGG patients, amino acid PET was not good enough and should be combined with FDG-PET to acquire a higher Spe. \n\nA confirmed diagnosis of recurrence during the follow-up of glioma patients is most important for choosing the next treatment method (secondary surgery or others). MRI is the most common and valuable method to monitor recurrence at present. From a review of some previous meta-analyses, the diagnostic accuracy of anatomical G-T1-MRI and advanced MRI is summarized in  . The accuracy of G-T1-MRI and DWI was obviously not adequate for the diagnosis of glioma recurrence ( ,  ). Advanced MRI showed a higher accuracy ( ,  ,  \u2013 ). Compared to advanced MRI, PET with different radiotracers did not present an obvious superiority in the differential diagnosis of glioma recurrence ( ). However, the high Sen of amino acid PET and high Spe of FDG-PET may suggest their combination in future applications of diagnosis. \n  \nPrevious meta-analysis of MRI accuracy for diagnosis of glioma recurrence. \n  \n ADC, apparent diffusion coefficient; Cho/Cr, choline/creatine; Cho/NAA, choline/N-acetyl-aspartate; DCE, dynamic contrast-enhanced; DSC, dynamic susceptibility contrast; DWI, diffusion-weighted imaging; G-T1-MRI, gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance; MRS, magnetic resonance spectroscopy; PWI, perfusion-weighted imaging; NR, not reported  . \n  \nSome previous meta-analyses evaluated the accuracy of PET, which did not show an obviously better performance than advanced MRI. Moreover, none of them took the different parameters (TBR, TTP, etc.) of PET into consideration ( \u2013 ). Along with the evaluation of PET with different tracers, this meta-analysis concentrated on the different accuracy of parameters of PET scans and showed more accuracy in the static parameter TBRmax of FET-PET than the dynamic parameter TTP. However, most studies in this review only performed static parameter analysis, and the accuracy of dynamic parameter analysis needs more research for evaluation. Regardless of these results, as a supplement to MRI, PET with different tracers and parameters can provide additional useful information by evaluating different metabolic pathways. \n\nFurthermore, the accuracy of FET-PET multi-parameter analysis or FET-PET/MRI in this meta-analysis was similar to that of FET-PET TBR alone ( ). FET-PET multi-parameter analysis and hybrid PET/MRI also were not more accurate than advanced MRI. Although hybrid PET/MRI seemed to be a promising technique for recurrent glioma diagnosis, quantitative meta-analyses are scarce, and its accuracy in our analysis was not satisfactory ( ,  ). PET-CT was also commonly used to differentiate TPR and PTRC in patients with brain metastases. A meta-analysis showed that pooled Sen and Spe of FDG-PET were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.92) and 0.88 (0.81, 0.95), respectively. The pooled Sen and Spe of amino acid PET were 0.84 (0.79, 0.90) and 0.85 (0.80, 0.91) ( ). These results were similar to the results in this review, thus it demonstrated similar diagnostic accuracy of PET differentiating TPR and PTRC both in glioma and brain metastases. \n\nTo acquire high diagnostic accuracy in the management of glioma as well as high feasibility and low cost to patients, the method of radiomics analysis is applied broadly now. PET radiomics combines datasets of static and dynamic PET parameters to make full use of imaging information. Precise image segmentation and feature extraction using different classification methods make it more accuracy in diagnosis. However, many studies demonstrated that a PET radiomics model had higher accuracy than the PET single parameter analysis in differentiating TPR from PTRC ( ,  ). Feature-based PET/MRI radiomics also showed higher accuracy ( ). One study used FDG PET, MET PET, and structural MRI images to develop an integrated radiomics-based model which showed a very high diagnostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.99 ( ). In this review we did not cover radiomics. Multi-parameter PET radiomics combined with other imaging modalities has indeed great potential in differentiating TRP and PTRC, and its diagnostic performance should be summarized and evaluated in future. \n\nSome limitations exist in this meta-analysis. First, while 33 studies were included, only three tested  F-DOPA PET, one tested  F-FLT PET, and one tested  C-CHO PET. So their credible diagnostic accuracy cannot be found in this review. The accuracy of  F-FET,  C-MET, and  F-FDG PET which was synthesized in this review was credible due to the support of enough studies. Second, some studies included a small number of patients, so the correction of zero replaced by 1 in 2 \u00d7 2 tables caused a large effect on these studies. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThis meta-analysis demonstrates that PET with different radiotracers has a moderate diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between glioma progression or recurrence and post treatment-related changes. However, their performance does not show an obvious advantage over advanced MRI. The high Sen of amino acid PET and high Spe of FDG-PET suggest that the combination of these two methods will yield a higher accuracy. The PET multi-parameter analysis and PET/MRI have a great clinical application prospect, their diagnostic performances require further research in large sample sizes in multicenter studies. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions generated for this study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nMC: conceptualization, methodology, software, formal analysis, resources, data curation, writing-original draft, and writing reviewing and editing.

Machine learning analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has shown potential in predicting response for individual patients, which may enable personalized treatment decisions and increase treatment efficacy. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of MRI-guided response prediction in MDD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies using MRI to predict single-subject response to antidepressant treatment in patients with MDD. Classification performance was calculated using a bivariate model and expressed as area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity. In addition, we analyzed differences in classification performance between different interventions and MRI modalities. Meta-analysis of 22 samples including 957 patients showed an overall area under the bivariate summary receiver operating curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.81\u20130.87), sensitivity of 77% (95% CI 71\u201382), and specificity of 79% (95% CI 73\u201384). Although classification performance was higher for electroconvulsive therapy outcome prediction (  n  \u2009=\u2009285, 80% sensitivity, 83% specificity) than medication outcome prediction (  n  \u2009=\u2009283, 75% sensitivity, 72% specificity), there was no significant difference in classification performance between treatments or MRI modalities. Prediction of treatment response using machine learning analysis of MRI data is promising but should not yet be implemented into clinical practice. Future studies with more generalizable samples and external validation are needed to establish the potential of MRI to realize individualized patient care in MDD. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disease, accounting for 40% of the global disability-adjusted life years caused by psychiatric disorders . Depression is associated with impaired social functioning and unemployment and is associated with a wide range of chronic physical illnesses, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease . MDD is estimated to have a life-time prevalence of 20.6% in the United States . Despite general consensus that effective treatment of depression is paramount for both a patient\u2019s health and for reducing global burden of disease, global disease burden by MDD has not decreased in the past decades . This is partly because treatment selection is based on trial and error, with no possibility to predict an individual\u2019s response to a certain treatment . Non-response to initial pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions is highly prevalent, with treatment-resistant depression affecting 20\u201330% of depressed patients in the current clinical practice . Treatment of choice for patients who have not responded to pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which produces remission in about 50% of therapy-resistant patients . Furthermore, non-response can only be determined at least 4 weeks after initiation of pharmacotherapy, ECT requires 4\u20136 weeks on average, and effects of psychotherapy can even take 16 weeks to manifest . Consequently, patients are regularly exposed to multiple failed treatments and might spend months to years waiting for successful treatment. This stresses the need for markers, which, before treatment commencement, can inform clinicians on the chance of responding to a particular treatment. \n\nA large number of studies have correlated baseline clinical characteristics and biomarkers with MDD status and treatment outcome and have identified many factors that are associated with treatment success . However, such descriptive analyses only provide inference at the group level and not at the level of the individual patient, which is required for clinical decision-making . More recent studies have started to use machine learning analyses that aim to develop predictive models and that are tested using independent data . More than with correlational analysis, single-subject response prediction studies using machine learning might be able to redeem the promise of individualized psychiatry . Without being explicitly pre-programmed, these algorithms (either linear or non-linear) are able to learn from aggregated data in a patient sample using multivariate pattern recognition, in order to provide the best prediction of an output variable . In predictive modeling, machine learning could enable clinicians to judge the viability of treatments for individual patients. As such, it might increase treatment efficacy, decrease illness duration, and reduce MDD\u2019s impact on the global burden of disease. \n\nMultiple modalities have been considered for single-subject response prediction. A recent meta-analysis covering different markers found neuroimaging to overall be most successful in predicting treatment response in depressed patients (i.e., more than phenomenological or genetic studies) . However, the review pooled different treatments and neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since it did not differentiate between prediction success in different neuroimaging techniques, the study offers little insight into treatment-specific biomarkers or specific (MRI) modalities. A recent meta-analysis on EEG for individual prediction of antidepressant treatment response found reasonable accuracy (72% sensitivity and 68% specificity) but concludes that EEG should not yet be used clinically as a prediction tool, since generalizability and validity of the reported studies are limited . However, a meta-analysis of prediction accuracy in anti-depressive treatment that specifically focuses on MRI does not yet exist, which may reveal a better predictive value than EEG. \n\nThe primary aim of the present study was to calculate the aggregate classification performance of predictive MRI biomarkers in patients with MDD using a bivariate random-effect model meta-analysis. We further investigated whether classification performance was influenced by intervention type (i.e., pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or ECT) or imaging modality (i.e., structural MRI (sMRI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), task-based fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)). \n\n\n## Methods and materials \n  \n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nTwo authors (S.E.C. and B.N.W.) included studies using any form of MRI (structural, resting-state, task-based, spectroscopy, DTI), which were conducted at baseline, i.e., within 4 weeks before the start of antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, inclusion criteria were an overarching definition of antidepressant treatment according to the current NICE guidelines and a non-selective patient population with MDD suffering from a current depressive episode. Studies that used feature selection based on in-sample data without validating prediction outcomes either internally (e.g., through cross-validation) or externally (through independent set validation) were excluded. Inclusion or exclusion conflicts were resolved by consensus or if necessary by authors J.B.Z. and G.A.v.W. \n\n\n### Search strategy \n  \nWe conducted a search in EMBASE, Medline, PsycInfo, and Web of Science databases. Each database was searched from inception to January 2020. Furthermore, we searched the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platforms search portal for registered and unpublished studies, and we looked for \u201cgray\u201d literature such as abstracts and conference articles through conference websites and from other relevant sources. Additionally, we checked included articles for references and conducted citation screening. For a full account of our search strategy and inclusion criteria, see the  . \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nTwo authors (S.E.C. and B.N.W.) independently extracted data from included studies, including the number of participants, patient population and depression severity subtype, treatment history, antidepressant intervention and outcome measures, response/remission rates, neuroimaging technique, brain region and feature selection, method of analysis, and validation strategy (see Table  ). From the included articles, we extracted the confusion table (a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 table for correctly and incorrectly classified patients) for sensitivity or specificity. If these were not supplied, we computed the matrix from additional information in the article. If multiple studies analyzed the same patient sample, we used mean outcome measures based on these studies. If necessary, we contacted authors requesting additional information.   \nMethodological summary of the studies. \n  \nReported sample sizes were not necessarily equal in articles with overlapping sample. \n\n SSRI   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,   TCA   tricyclic antidepressant,   SNRI   serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor,   ECT   electroconvulsive therapy,   CBT   cognitive behavioral therapy,   rTMS   repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation,   iTBS   intermittent theta burst stimulation,   AP   antipsychotics,   ns   not specified,   tb   task based,   rs   resting state,   asl   arterial spin labeling,   fMRI   functional magnetic resonance imaging,   sMRI   structural magnetic resonance imaging,   WB   whole brain,   ROI   region of interest,   DTI   diffusion tensor imaging,   lSVM   linear support vector machine,   RBF   radial basic function,   TCP   transductive conformal predictor,   LR   logistic regression,   LinR   linear regression,   LDA   linear discriminant analysis,   RF   random forest,   LOO CV   leave-one-out cross-validation,   wm   white matter,   sLR   stepwise linear regression,   beta-w   beta-weights,   LARS   least-angle regression,   PMVD   proportional marginal decomposition. \n\n n   is a weighted average across studies. \n  \n\n\n### Meta-analytic method \n  \nFor quantitative analysis, we used confusion matrices to pool studies using Reitsma\u2019s bivariate random effect model, as suggested in the Cochrane handbook for diagnostic tests of accuracy studies . We used this method for computing our main outcomes, which were the overall area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as sensitivity and specificity of intervention subsets. Additionally, we performed a separate bivariate regression for modalities (fMRI and sMRI) by including from each study both sMRI and fMRI, if provided in the original article or after our request for further information. As a post hoc analysis, we excluded DTI from this regression, and in the fMRI group, we subdivided resting-state and task-based modalities. \n\n\n### Heterogeneity and publication bias \n  \nTo visualize between-study differences, we conducted a univariate random-effect forest plot of the diagnostic odds ratios (ORs), subdivided per treatment group. We identified clinical and statistical heterogeneity by visually assessing confidence interval (CI) overlap and by identifying outlying studies. We avoided using an objective measure of heterogeneity, since these have shown to be inappropriately conservative for accuracy studies . Rather, we used a random-effect model that assumes that our data was heterogeneous and set out to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity . We did not perform any sensitivity analyses, as no studies were of such low quality, or were such outliers that sensitivity analysis was appropriate. To assess sample size effects and possible publication bias, we used Deeks\u2019 test, as recommended for diagnostic accuracy studies . For assessing quality of the primary studies, we used the QUADAS-2 tool . We pre-specified methods in the PROSPERO database for systematic reviews (registration number CRD42019137497). All analyses were conducted using the mada and metafor package in R . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search results \n  \nOur search yielded 5824 hits, 168 of which were included for full-text review (see Fig.  ). After contacting the authors for additional information, we excluded 21 studies for not reporting data necessary for reconstructing a confusion matrix, all of which were \u201cgray literature\u201d, i.e., abstracts or conference summary articles. Furthermore, we excluded 11 articles for not reporting any form of validation of their prediction model. After exclusion of non-eligible studies and, through citation searching, addition of 2 eligible studies that did not come up in search hits, 27 remained .    Flow diagram of the study inclusion process.  \n n   number. \n  \n\n\n### Description of the study characteristics \n  \nWe included 27 studies with an accumulated number of 957 unique patients and a mean sample size of 44 per study, with a median of 33 (see Table   for a full methodological study summary. Please refer to Supplementary Table   for an overview of patient characteristics and study demographics). Three patient samples were used in more than one article . \n\nOf the included studies, 50% used some form of pharmacotherapeutic intervention (total   n  \u2009=\u2009283), all of which administered a clinically viable dosage, with response time varying from 2 weeks (early response) to 12 weeks. Only one study did not use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), instead using an serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) . Three studies used either an SSRI or SNRI, and one of these three chose a tricyclic antidepressant as a third treatment option . ECT was administered in 35% of studies (total   n  \u2009=\u2009285), 8% used transcranial magnetic stimulation, and 8% used cognitive therapy. Most studies used either sMRI (31%) or task-based fMRI (31%), most often using emotional stimuli, 19% used resting-state fMRI, and 8% used DTI. Two studies combined multiple modalities . \n\nAs machine learning paradigm, 31% studies used support vector machine (SVM) for data-analysis, while 28% used logistic regression. After comparing classification accuracy with multiple algorithms (among others, SVM and random forest), Patel and colleagues used an alternating decision tree method . For validation, 85% used leave-one-out cross-validation. Two studies used an independent cohort to validate their results, while one study first cross-validated classification results, after which authors validated their prediction model in two small, independent cohorts, achieving similar results . For additional information on approaches to imaging analysis, please refer to Supplementary Table  . \n\n\n### Meta-analysis \n  \n#### General outcome \n  \nAfter pooling results from studies with overlapping patient samples, we quantitatively analyzed 22 samples, including one independent cohort replication that we have interpreted as a separate study . For all imaging modalities and interventions taken together, the meta-analytic estimate for the SROC AUC was 0.84 (95% CI 0.81\u20130.87), with 77% sensitivity (95% CI 71\u201382) and 79% specificity (95% CI 73\u201384), amounting to a moderately high classification performance (see Fig.  ).    Overall accuracy measures: area under the curve 0.84 (95% CI 0.81\u20130.87), sensitivity 77% (95% CI 71\u201382), specificity 79% (95% CI 73\u201384).  \nReitsma bivariate SROC model of the receiver operating characteristic curve.

ECT electroconvulsive therapy, rTMS repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, pharmacological pharmacotherapeutic antidepressive interventions. \n  \n\n\n#### Intervention differences \n  \nSensitivity and specificity of ECT interventions were 80% (95% CI 73\u201385) and 83% (95% CI 72\u201390), respectively, compared to 75% (95% CI 68\u201382) and 72% (95% CI 64\u201380) for antidepressant medication. Exclusion of the studies that did not use SSRI as pharmacological agent had little influence on the results . Although prediction outcomes in ECT studies do show a trend toward higher precision, CIs overlapped (see Table  ). With only few primary studies, sensitivity and specificity for psychotherapy were, respectively, 84% (95% CI 68\u201392) and 72% (39\u201392), for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), respectively, 79% (95% CI 71\u201386) and 82% (74\u201388).   \nSummary estimates of sensitivity/specificity for different interventions. \n  \n CI   confidence interval,   rTMS   repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation,   ECT   electroconvulsive therapy. \n  \n\n\n#### Modality differences \n  \nIn order to assess whether sMRI studies yielded different performance measures compared to fMRI studies, we performed random-effect meta-regression for modality subtypes. When comparing fMRI and sMRI,   z  -regression values for sensitivities and specificities were non-significant, suggesting that prediction success for structural or functional neuroimaging did not differ between studies (see Table  ). Post hoc analysis excluding DTI and subdividing task-based and resting-state fMRI did not alter the results.   \nBivariate random-effect meta-regression   z  -scores for modality as covariate. \n  \n p   Values for both sensitivity and specificity >0.05, i.e.,   z  -score differences for functional and structural MRI are non-significant. \n  \n\n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nThree studies included only late-life depression, which reduces applicability in the general MDD population (see Supplementary Fig.   and Supplementary Table  ). In terms of flow and timing, drop-outs were a common issue, with 10 studies having a drop-out rate of \u226530%, while 11 studies did not clarify drop-outs, possibly leading to attrition bias. Furthermore, two studies adapted the definition of response to create an even split in responders/non-responders, causing applicability concerns . One study did not pre-specify the pharmacological intervention . \n\n\n### Heterogeneity and publication bias \n  \nThe univariate forest plot of diagnostic performance (in ln OR) showed considerable overlap in CIs between studies with different ORs, indicating that heterogeneity might be caused by sample variance (see Fig.  ) . As described in the study description above, inter-study differences were present in population, modalities, intervention type, response/remission definition, feature selection, and analysis technique. Deeks\u2019 funnel plot asymmetry test showed study size and diagnostic OR to be inversely related (  p  \u2009=\u20090.044; see Supplementary Fig.  ), indicating that classification performance was lower in studies with larger samples. Inspection of the gray literature that was excluded due to missing information in order to construct a confusion matrix (all of which were conference/poster abstracts) showed that the gray literature had comparable mean sample sizes (  n  \u2009=\u200922, mean   n  \u2009=\u200956) and accuracies (ranging from 73 to 95%) compared to the included studies.

CI confidence interval, rTMS repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, ECT electroconvulsive therapy. \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur results show that machine learning analysis of MRI data can predict antidepressive treatment success with an AUC of 0.84, 77% sensitivity, and 79% specificity (Fig.  ). Furthermore, we did not find a difference in classification performance between studies using pharmacotherapy and ECT. Although ECT showed somewhat higher sensitivity and specificity, CIs largely overlapped between the two intervention types (Table  ). There were few primary studies for psychotherapy and rTMS, which also show overlapping CIs. In addition, classification performance of sMRI and fMRI did not differ significantly (Table  ). \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis specifically examining MRI for predicting treatment effects in depression. The overall classification performance is comparable to the one reported by Lee et al., who found a general accuracy of 85% when combining the results for different neuroimaging modalities (defined as EEG, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, or MRI) . Those results were, however, based on a total of 8 MRI studies, whereas our search resulted in 22 individual studies for analysis. This is partly due to the time gap between studies, which underscores the rapid development in this research area. Our results show that MRI prediction studies perform somewhat better than EEG (AUC of 0.76) and comparable to accuracy of   diagnostic   classification studies with MRI that distinguishes depressed patients and healthy controls . In contrast to the review of EEG studies, we excluded studies that tested their model on the training set, which increased generalizability of our sample and avoided presenting inflated accuracy results. \n\nClinical practice would require different prediction approaches for a broad range of specific settings. It would be useful to have a single predictive test for therapy-resistant patients, especially to guide decision-making for invasive treatments such as ECT. For example, ECT is associated with cognitive side effects that are preferably avoided in case the treatment is unsuccessful . In addition, ECT is only applied in 1\u20132% of patients with persistent or severe depression and a biomarker that indicates a high probability of success may reduce the hesitance of its use . However, for most treatments, a differential biomarker would be preferable, which would enable selecting the treatment with the highest chance of success. As of yet, no MRI study has used such prospective prediction and subsequent treatment matching to guide decision-making between two treatment options (for instance, between cognitive behavioral therapy and an SSRI). Furthermore, no studies have yet compared efficacy of prediction-guided treatments versus regular treatment based on patient\u2013clinician preference. Thus, although the predictive performance of MRI biomarkers is certainly promising, the current study designs do not yet enable the translation of research findings to the clinic. \n\nGenerally, studies were of acceptable quality, although drop-out rates could cause concern in terms of reliability. Drop-out rates were not mentioned in 11 studies, and for 10 studies, drop-out rates were >30% without using an intention-to-diagnose approach. Not accounting for drop-outs, who might be less likely to respond to treatment, could inflate response/remission data and consequently alter sensitivity and specificity of the predictive test. Additionally, our results show between-study variety regarding the response criterion, which typically consisted of clinical response (\u226550% symptom reduction) or symptom remission. Different clinical settings might require different prediction outcomes. For instance, one could expect treatment of a first-time depressive episode to lead to complete remission, while in severe treatment-resistant depression, response might be a more practical and achievable goal . Authors should take care to pre-specify which outcome they will use and why that outcome is the most appropriate for their sample or intervention. \n\nFurthermore, although no objective investigation for clinical heterogeneity in prediction studies exists, our random-effect forest plot shows considerable overlap of CIs with differing study results, implying the presence of sampling variation (Fig.  ) . Clinical variance between samples is an important obstacle in generalizability of any diagnostic or predictive marker, especially in psychiatric illnesses such as MDDs, which is heterogeneous in both its clinical and neurophysiological manifestation . Thus, inter-sample diversity of inclusion criteria and methodological design might hamper the realization of a reliable predictive biomarker. \n\nIn the current literature on diagnostic accuracy studies, the possibility of publication selection as a source of bias is still under debate . Common forms of formalizations of publication bias, such as the Egger\u2019s or Begg\u2019s test, are not recommended for meta-analyses of prediction studies, since their sensitivity in diagnostic accuracy studies is generally poor . However, the recommended Deeks\u2019 funnel plot asymmetry test (see Supplementary Fig.  ) shows the presence of a sample size effect, with the   n   of a study being negatively correlated to classification performance, which could be attributable to publication bias . Another explanation of this significant correlation might be that large-scale studies with large samples are more likely to consist of heterogeneous patient groups, which in turn reduces prediction accuracy . As a further exploration of publication bias, our search also took into account gray literature, which indicated that publication (or positive result) bias was absent. In conclusion, quantitative testing could not distinguish between a real effect (due to accuracy reduction in large heterogeneous samples) or publication bias. Although the gray literature deems its presence less likely, we cannot exclude the presence of publication bias. \n\nThe following limitations warrant further discussion. First, we did not find modality differences, but studies conducting fMRI research might have also attempted prediction with (less time-consuming and cheaper) sMRI, which remained unpublished. Although we did contact authors for additional information, response was poor, so we were unable to rule out reporting bias for modality differences. We would advise authors of future studies to publish non-significant results as well as significant but less accurate results, since both are potentially useful in comparing the merits of different modalities. Second, the number of studies predicting the effects of psychotherapy, specifically cognitive therapy, outcome was low, resulting in a blind spot for a commonly deployed treatment in MDD . Third, cross-validation in small samples results in large variation of the estimated accuracy, and as indicated above, accuracy reduces with larger sample heterogeneity . Since the mean sample size of our studies was 44 (with a median   n   of 33), the reported results may be optimistic because of overfitting. Overfitting is a cause for concern specifically in MRI studies, with relatively small sample sizes and large amounts of fitted data . Furthermore, characteristics of the test set during cross-validation will approximate the characteristics of the training set more than when tested in the general population, due to selection bias . Only two included studies replicated their training data in an independent cohort, and one included study used an out-of-sample cohort to further test their cross-validated results, leaving the question open to which extent the majority of results can be generalized to new patients. \n\nIn order to optimize patient care, reduce treatment resistance, and shorten duration of illness, developing models that predict treatment success on individual-patient level is an urgent task. In a 2012 consensus report on diagnostic imaging markers in psychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association research council proposed 80% sensitivity and specificity as prerequisite for the clinical application of a biomarker . Furthermore, biomarkers should be ideally be reliable, reproducible, non-invasive, simple to perform, and inexpensive. The results for an ECT biomarker fulfilled the 80% criterion, but the results for a medication biomarker fell short. But following these terms, primarily reproducibility has not yet been sufficiently well established with small sample sizes and external validation in only a minority of studies. This precludes recommending MRI for treatment response prediction in clinical practice at this point. Future multicenter studies with large patient samples that represent clinical heterogeneity are required to warrant MRI biomarker generalizability . However, one might question whether excellent generalizability is a goal that should be aimed for: if each clinical site were to develop its own locally reliable and replicable biomarker that incorporates the local hardware, patient, and treatment variability, the predictive accuracy is expected to be higher than when all potential sources of heterogeneity are accounted for . Standard machine learning analysis would, then, mean a departure from the traditional universalist paradigm in diagnostics and instead initiate a shift to a paradigm of localization: heterogeneous yet locally applicable classification models. This will enable to retrain predictive models to obtain even better performance with more data after biomarker deployment. And this may enable to take advantage rather than disadvantage from (inevitable) hardware upgrades, such as higher signal-to-noise for new generations of MR scanners and coils. \n\nIn conclusion, prediction of treatment success using machine learning analysis of MRI data holds promise but has not transcended the research status and should not yet be implemented into clinical practice. Once it overcomes the aforementioned hurdles, MRI may become a clinical decision support tool aimed to reduce unsuccessful treatments and improve treatment efficacy and efficiency. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7960732, "text_md5": "45c757d7297f6c74f6bbeb3a2757d34c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 114], "journal": [115, 132], "publication_year": [134, 138], "title": [149, 291], "keywords": [305, 348], "abstract": [361, 2090], "body": [2099, 29684]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33723229, "doi": "10.1038/s41398-021-01286-x", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7960732", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7960732"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7960732\">7960732</a>", "list_title": "PMC7960732  Magnetic resonance imaging for individual prediction of treatment response in major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis"}

Amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI are the two subtypes of MCI with the former having a higher risk for progressing to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared with healthy elderly adults, individuals with MCI have specific functional alterations in the salience network (SN). However, no consistent results are documenting these changes. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the specific functional alterations in the SN in MCI and aMCI. \n\n Methods:   We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for scientific neuroimaging literature based on three research methods, namely, functional connectivity (FC), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation or fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF/fALFF). Then, we conducted the coordinate-based meta-analysis by using the activation likelihood estimation algorithm. \n\n Results:   In total, 30 functional neuroimaging studies were included. After extracting the data and analyzing it, we obtained specific changes in some brain regions in the SN including decreased ALFF/fALFF in the left superior temporal gyrus, the insula, the precentral gyrus, and the precuneus in MCI and aMCI; increased FC in the thalamus, the caudate, the superior temporal gyrus, the insula, and the cingulate gyrus in MCI; and decreased ReHo in the anterior cingulate gyrus in aMCI. In addition, as to FC, interactions of the SN with other networks including the default mode network and the executive control network were also observed mainly in the middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus in MCI and inferior frontal gyrus in aMCI. \n\n Conclusions:   Specific functional alternations in the SN and interactions of the SN with other networks in MCI could be useful as potential imaging biomarkers for MCI or aMCI. Meanwhile, it provided a new insight in predicting the progression of health to MCI or aMCI and novel targets for proper intervention to delay the progression. \n\n Systematic Review Registration:   [PROSPERO], identifier [No. CRD42020216259]. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is universally considered as the predementia phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Gao et al.,  ). About one in five community-dwelling elders aged 65 years and above suffer from MCI (Livingston et al.,  ). MCI has been divided into two subtypes, amnestic MCI (aMCI) and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI), according to the difference of impaired cognitive domain. The former manifests as memory deficit combined with or without slight impairment of other cognitive domains and converts to AD at a high rate of 10\u201315% per annum (Cai et al.,  ). Some researchers have estimated that the number of patients with AD would be reduced by half if the onset of AD is delayed by five years (Butterfield and Boyd-Kimball,  ). Furthermore, accurate diagnosis of the early or preclinical stage of AD can provide a basis for early intervention. Therefore, determining the specific change of MCI or aMCI is important. Studies have used the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) for investigating neuronal integrity and functional alteration in the brain of patients with MCI (Khazaee et al.,  ; Zhu et al.,  ). Salience network (SN), which is involved in affections, attention, emotions, and switching between cognitive resources, is significantly affected in patients with MCI (Chen H. et al.,  ). Many studies have reported functional alterations in the SN in MCI when compared with healthy controls (HCs). However, there were no consistent results (Chen J. et al.,  ). Thus, our study aimed to conclude the characteristic abnormalities of the SN in MCI by analyzing previous investigations. \n\nThe rs-fMRI has been widely used to detect functional changes, such as disruptions in network integrity in the brain, and to predict future cognitive decline in normal elderly participants or MCI (Kaiser et al.,  ; Buckley et al.,  ). Functional connectivity (FC), the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) or fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo) are the three main methods used for measuring functional changes (Harrington et al.,  ; Cheng et al.,  ). FC, based on independent component analysis (ICA) or seed regions of interest (seed-ROI) analysis, reflects the functional relationship between two or more regions of the brain (Mamah et al.,  ; Chand et al.,  ). ALFF and fALFF are used for quantitatively assessing the total voxel-wise amplitude of the local features of the brain oscillatory activities. The latter is more specific because its measure includes the entire frequency range, and it attenuates the influence of physiological noise (Han et al.,  ; Qing et al.,  ). ReHo, which is based on the similarity of neighboring voxels over a time series, can be used to determine the functional change of the local brain area. It is highly reliable for studying the consistency of local brain activity (Zang et al.,  ; Li M. G. et al.,  ). Thus, the three methods mentioned above have their virtues in investigating brain networks to understand the functional changes in MCI. \n\nThe SN, as one of the three core neurocognitive networks [the default mode network (DMN), SN, and the executive control network (ECN)], plays a vital role in cognitive function. It is a task-positive network, serving to identify relevant stimuli for guiding behavior in response to several internal and external stimuli, and is relevant for attention and the interoceptive process (Menon,  ; Supekar et al.,  ). Many studies have reported functional changes of the SN in patients with cognitive impairment (Agosta et al.,  ; Onoda et al.,  ). In addition, multiple studies have examined the relationships between SN and other networks. Li et al. found that the SN-centered \u201ctriple-network model\u201d was impaired in patients with cognitive decline by comparing 33 AD, 24 late MCI, and 25 control subjects (Li et al.,  ). However, the lack of data makes it difficult to find reliable specific imaging markers in the SN to predict the transformation from healthy elders to MCI or MCI to AD. Thus, concluding consistent results of alterations in the SN is essential. \n\nActivation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique is a powerful meta-analysis method based on random-effects interference and controlling for sample size, which uses peak coordinates reported in selected studies as Gaussian probability distributions (Kollndorfer et al.,  ). It avoids the shortcoming of uncertainty of the actual abnormal position by using the coordinates of abnormal sites instead of area label (H\u00e9tu et al.,  ). A study by Chen et al. analyzed the structural brain changes in MCI using ALE and suggested that regional alternations might serve as early predictive or diagnostic biomarkers for MCI (Chen et al.,  ). Nevertheless, this study was the first one to assess functional specific changes in the SN in patients with MCI and aMCI. \n\nOur study aimed to comprehensively analyze and conclude the specific functional alterations of brain areas in the SN and discuss the specific abnormal markers within the SN as well as its interaction with other networks in MCI. We proposed the hypothesis that (1) the three indexes (i.e., ALFF/fALFF, ReHo, and FC) of the SN would show specific neuroimaging changes in some brain regions, (2) specific changes would be different in MCI and aMCI, and (3) interactions between SN and other networks could be observed in MCI and aMCI. A detailed understanding of the specific functional alterations of the SN in MCI will provide a more profound understanding of the pathological mechanism of such patients and may help better establish rehabilitation procedures along those lines. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Search Strategy \n  \nA systematic research of studies was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement and then recorded using the suggested checklist. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for rs-fMRI scientific literature published in English between January 1, 2000 and April 1, 2021. Search keywords were as follows: (1) (salience network) AND (\u201cmild cognitive impairment\u201d [MeSH]) AND (\u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d [MeSH]) AND (Resting state) AND [(functional connectivity) OR (fc)], (2) (\u201cmild cognitive impairment\u201d [MeSH]) AND (\u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d [MeSH]) AND (Resting state) AND [(regional homogeneity) OR (ReHo)] OR (local consistency), (3) (\u201cmild cognitive impairment\u201d [MeSH]) AND (\u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d [MeSH]) AND (Resting state) AND [(amplitude of low frequency fluctuations) OR (ALFF)], and (4) (\u201cmild cognitive impairment\u201d [MeSH]) AND (\u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d [MeSH]) AND (Resting state) AND [(fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations) OR (fALFF)]. \n\nA total of 353 publications were initially retrieved. After careful screening, a total of 30 publications (7 FC, 13 ALFF/fALFF, 8 ReHo, and 2 ALFF/fALFF & ReHo) were included in the final analysis ( ). Among the included studies, a total of 18 studies met the criteria of aMCI (4 FC, 8 ALFF/fALFF, 5 ReHo, and 1 ALFF/fALFF & ReHo). However, mainly due to the absence of detailed information on neuropsychological assessment, no study met the criteria of naMCI. \n  \nFlowchart shows study selection process. \n  \n\n### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria \n  \nStudies related to rs-fMRI investigations on MCI were included if they (1) reported significant alterations of FC, ALFF/fALFF, or ReHo in the SN using thresholds uncorrected with spatial extent thresholds or corrected for multiple comparisons; (2) made comparisons between MCI and HCs; (3) reported information about the stereotactic space in Talairach or Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) coordinates; and (4) were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. The patients with MCI met the following criteria: (a) evidence of the complaint of cognitive change, (b) impairment in one or more cognitive domains, (c) preservation of the independence of function in daily life, and (d) not demented (Albert et al.,  ). The MCI group was further divided into two types, namely, the aMCI group and the naMCI group, based on whether the cognitive impairment was dominated by memory (Cooper et al.,  ). Only the study with the largest sample size, to avoid repeat count, was included. \n\nStudies investigating patients with MCI with a history of other diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, depression, focal epilepsy, and stroke, were excluded unless they included the group of MCIs with no other concurrent diseases. Meta-analysis, reviews, animal experiments, conference meeting abstracts, case reports, studies without group-level statistics, and articles lacking necessary baseline information were not included in the analysis. \n\nMoreover, the quality of the individual studies was evaluated using the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale (NOS) by two reviewers. Three major domains (i.e., selection, comparability, and the ascertainment of outcome) were included in this scale rates (Lo et al.,  ). At any point, any disagreement between reviewers was resolved by means of meeting and discussion among all authors to establish a consensus. \n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nTwo researchers independently conducted the data extraction and then checked the accuracy of extracted data. When disagreements appeared, a third reviewer participated in the discussion until a consensus was reached. \n\nIn terms of studies focused on FC, studies investigating the FC within the SN or intra-FC between SN and other networks such as the DMN and ECN were all included, and the coordinate of brain regions that revealed significant changes was extracted. Due to the limited number of included studies, we did not further group according to the difference of methods. \n\nIn terms of studies focused on ALFF/fALFF and ReHo, which were voxel-wise whole-brain indexes, first, we reviewed all the studies investigating functional alterations in MCI based on ICA or seed ROI to summarize brain areas belong to the SN. According to the results, we extracted the coordinates of brain regions in the SN which revealed significant changes. \n\n\n### Data Analysis Procedure \n  \nThe results of the three different methods were divided into increased group and decreased group: (a) MCI: increased ALFF/ fALFF (168 subjects, seven foci, six experiments); decreased ALFF/fALFF (321 subjects, 21 foci, 12 experiments); increased ReHo (166 subjects, eight foci, seven experiments); decreased ReHo (138 subjects, six foci, five experiments); increased FC (111 subjects, 15 foci, four experiments); decreased FC (63 subjects, 26 foci, four experiments). (b) aMCI: increased ALFF/fALFF (126 subjects, four foci, four experiments); decreased ALFF/fALFF (236 subjects, 16 foci, eight experiments); increased ReHo (78 subjects, four foci, three experiments); decreased ReHo (126 subjects, five foci, four experiments); increased FC (30 subjects, one foci, one experiments); decreased FC (47 subjects, five foci, three experiments). \n\nData were calculated using a Java-based version of Ginger ALE 2.3.6 ( ) (Browndyke et al.,  ). Ginger ALE determined whether there was anatomical or functional convergence of differences among multiple coordinate-based human brain imaging studies (Mar,  ). After transforming Talairach coordinates into MNI space, we sorted all the foci and basic information into six text files. These files were subsequently imported into the software to read the foci. The cluster-forming threshold at   p   < 0.01 was set to obtain the ALE map with a cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction at   p   < 0.05 and 1,000 permutations (Eickhoff et al.,  ). \n\nHowever, among the studies included in the analysis, there was one study that reported increased FC of the SN of the left anterior insula in aMCI, compared with HCs. Only one coordinate was available, and thus, the ALE analysis was not conducted in this group (Li X. et al.,  ). \n\nFollowing the ALE analysis, a jackknife sensitivity analysis was performed by iteratively repeating the same analysis, excluding one dataset each time to test the replicability of results across studies (Lyles and Lin,  ). However, due to the limitation of the number of included studies involving different indicators, the sensitivity analysis was performed only on the group of decreased ALFF/fALFF in MCI (a total of 12 included studies). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search Results \n  \nDetails about the demographics and characteristics of the included studies are summarized in  . The quality assessment of the included studies ranged from low scores of 5 and moderate scores of 6\u20137 to high scores of 8.

The decreased ALFF/fALFF in the left precuneus remained significant in at least nine combinations of the datasets. The results are presented in the  . \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo the best of our knowledge, this meta-analysis was the first to assess the functional integrity of the SN in MCI and aMCI. Compared with the healthy group, the specific abnormal brain regions in MCI were mainly located in the frontal lobe, including MFG, SFG, and PreCG; the limbic lobe, including cingulate gyrus; and the occipital lobe, including precuneus. Besides, there were also differences in the temporal lobe, including STG, and sub-lobar, including the thalamus and the caudate. Patients with aMCI demonstrated specific changes in the bilateral ACG and the left IFG. \n\n### Specific Imaging Abnormal Changes in SN \n  \nBoth patients with MCI and patients with aMCI showed decreased ALFF/fALFF in the left STG, left insula, left PreCG, and the precuneus. This indicated that the intrinsic neural activity of these regions had significant dysfunction in MCI and aMCI when compared with HCs (Zhao et al.,  ; Zhuang et al.,  ). \n\nThe STG is related to the cognition process and social interaction and plays an important role in the function of language (Li et al.,  ). Dysfunction of the STG may result in the impairment of language and social skills in MCI. Localized changes of the STG were present after mindfulness practice for three months in subjects with MCI (Fam et al.,  ). The insula, especially the anterior insula, is a critical node of the SN which connects many areas including the prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobe and engages in the transformation between cognitive domains (Cerliani et al.,  ). A study by Na et al. reported that the MCI subgroup revealed focal activation in the left anterior insula and ACC after 24 sessions of computerized cognitive training (Na et al.,  ). The PreCG, which overlaps with the SMA, is involved in producing and controlling the movement (Cai et al.,  ). Abnormalities in the PreCG may affect learning and memorizing and show sluggish behavior; a positive correlation between the damage of this region and dysfunction of verbal short-term memory was reported in MCI (Bi et al.,  ; Sakurai et al.,  ). Increased blood oxygen level-dependent signal activation in the PreCG in MCI after daily supplementation for 16 weeks was reported by a clinical study that investigated the curative effect of blueberry supplementation (Boespflug et al.,  ). The precuneus is associated with mental imagery, source memory, and working memory (Utevsky et al.,  ). Decreased activity of neurons in the precuneus was shown to be connected with a steeper decline of global cognition function (Verfaillie et al.,  ). Patients in the early stages of AD have been shown to present hypoperfusion or metabolic reduction of the precuneus, and a positive correlation between the weaker function of the precuneus and lower MoCA score or lower working memory performance has been reported (Miners et al.,  ; Yokosawa et al.,  ). Therefore, when converting from health to MCI, the dysfunction of these brain regions would occur, which could be considered as the neuroimaging marker of MCI. Moreover, these brain regions can be regarded as the target for intervention treatment and follow-up care. \n\nOur meta-analysis also observed increased FC in the thalamus, the caudate, and the left STG/insula in MCI when compared with HCs. The thalamus contributes to attentional control by high-fidelity information relay to cortical regions and shifting and sustaining functional interactions across cortical areas and is conventionally recognized to be affected by AD pathology (Halassa and Kastner,  ). Pathological studies of thalamic involvement in AD demonstrated that nearly all thalamic nuclei got extracellular amyloid deposits, as well as the presence of thalamic volume loss (Ryan et al.,  ). The caudate contributes to behavior via activating correct action schemas and selecting opportune sub-goals and is associated with various higher neurological functions. A recent study that analyzed resting-state networks in prodromal AD also detected increased FC in the caudate in patients with positive biomarkers suggestive of incipient AD (Conwell et al.,  ). Previous studies had confirmed that the reduced volume of the caudate was significant with MCI-to-AD conversion (Madsen et al.,  ). Thus, we demonstrated that increased FC of the thalamus and the caudate in the SN, which may be considered as a compensated mechanism within the SN in MCI, can also be a specific marker of converting from health to MCI. The absence of this mechanism predicts the progress from MCI to dementia. \n\nBesides, significantly increased FC and decreased ALFF/fALFF were simultaneously observed in the left STG/insula in MCI, compared with HCs. Studies have demonstrated that the ALFF/fALFF focuses on the intrinsic neural oscillation alterations, while the FC focuses on the connective relationship of the brain (Chen et al.,  ; Zhou et al.,  ). Therefore, the increased connectivity of the SN in these two areas may make up for deficits in their neuronal activity. Moreover, we hypothesized that further dysfunction of partial neurons of some brain regions would occur in subjects when converting to MCI. However, the other neurons of these brain regions could make some compensation by increasing their own activity or by connecting with others to maintain their cognitive state. Increased alteration in the STG/insula, as well as the increased FC in the left thalamus and the caudate, observed in this study could make up for the dysfunction to some extent, and the STG/insula might be the most susceptible one. As the disease progresses, the normal functional patterns are affected and partial compensatory is necessary. \n\nWith regard to ReHo, few studies have reported significant changes in the SN in MCI. An rs-fMRI study composing 30 MCI and 32 HCs revealed an increased alteration in the left precuneus in MCI (Wang et al.,  ), and other studies reported an increase in the left lingual gyrus or the right MFG, compared with HCs (Yuan X. et al.,  ; Luo et al.,  ). Some studies have demonstrated a reduction in changes in the right SG, the left MFG, or the left ACC (Zhang et al.,  ; Yuan B. et al.,  ). However, in this study, we did not observe consistent results from the ALE analysis. This could be explained by the fact that limited rs-fMRI studies focusing on the SN to investigate ReHo changes in MCI were available. Moreover, different stages of MCI may present different changes in the SN. \n\nIn terms of patients with aMCI, compared with HCs, besides consistent results of alterations in MCI, diminished ReHo was explicitly observed in the bilateral ACG, which indicated that local synchronization of the bilateral ACG was significantly declined in aMCI (Bai et al.,  ; Zhang et al.,  ). The ACG, in healthy and clinical individuals, plays a vital role in the conflict-monitoring process in attentional tasks (Borsa et al.,  ). Luks et al. reported that in the clinical populations, the atrophy of ACC and DLPFC in the left hemisphere was directly associated with poorer attentional control accuracy in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, compared with HCs (Luks et al.,  ). It is also imperative to note that studies have confirmed the impairment of endogenously orienting attention in patients with aMCI and AD. Furthermore, several studies combining MRI and SPECT have reported that aMCI converters can augment hypometabolism in ACG, when compared with subjects who did not convert to AD (Van Dam et al.,  ; McLaughlin et al.,  ). Therefore, the specific alteration of the ACG may help to distinguish aMCI from healthy elderly and even predict whether patients with aMCI will convert to AD. \n\n\n### Salience Network Interaction With Other Networks \n  \nReviewing the results of ALE analysis of the FC of the SN, interactions of the SN with DMN and ECN had been observed in MCI or aMCI. The key areas exhibiting interactions with DMN included the SFC and the ACC (Liao et al.,  ; Cunningham et al.,  ), and the ones showing interactions with ECN were mainly the SFG and the IFG (Xu et al.,  ). Recently, studies based on three large-scale functional brain networks or a triple-network model, the DMN, SN, and ECN, have been carried out (Joo et al.,  ; Li et al.,  ; Yu et al.,  ). The main functions of the three networks are not similar but they have anatomical coincident areas and co-activation. Regulating other networks might be a possible function of the SN, and dysregulated interactions among the three networks closely correlate with the cognitive dysfunction (Jilka et al.,  ; Liao et al.,  ). \n\nThe DMN, which is the main focus of neural-related rs-fMRI, is a task-negative network associated with information processing related to memory, emotion, and learning and contributes to support mind wandering during self-referential mental processing. The network is active when the individual is in the resting state (Esposito et al.,  ). The SN is coupling with the DMN, and the increased coupling within the two networks can be observed across cognitive tasks (Elton and Gao,  ). Converging evidence indicates a linear relationship between the amyloid deposition and the dysfunction of DMN connectivity (Schultz et al.,  ). Previous studies concerning a deficit in DMN revealed a much more significant alteration in the AD group, thereby suggesting that the DMN had a progression of the connectivity deficit (Zhu et al.,  ). Consistent with previous reports, our results demonstrated that the SFG, which is one of the typical regions of the DMN, showed lower FC with the SN in MCI groups when compared with HCs (Liang et al.,  ). The ACC is the anterior part of the cingulate cortex (Torta et al.,  ). This brain region is the core one of the SN and is involved in integrating and coordinating information to guide behavior (Colangeli et al.,  ; Zeuner et al.,  ). However, the posterior part of the cingulate cortex (posterior cingulate cortex, PCC) is the core node of the DMN (Vogt,  ; Cera et al.,  ). Studies have shown disrupted FC in the PCC in MCI when compared with HCs (Dillen et al.,  ). According to the posterior-to-anterior shift in aging theory, the cognitive performance is maintained by the recruitment of anterior regions when the function of the posterior region is impaired (Grady,  ; Skouras et al.,  ). Compared with HCs, the increased FC of the ACC in the SN in MCI might be interpreted as a compensation mechanism to counter decay affected by impairments of posterior regions, thereby suggesting that the interaction among networks may be associated with a structural location. \n\nThe ECN governs executive functions, including problem-solving and working memory, and plays a key role in the regulation of cognition and the integration of memory and sensory information (Xu et al.,  ). Patients with MCI showed a significantly decreased FC, as well as increased FC, of the SN in the left MFG compared with HCs (He et al.,  ). The MFG is important for the execution of emotion regulation strategies (Japee et al.,  ). The executive functional impairment is considered to aggravate memory decline (Yuan B. et al.,  ). When the executive function of individuals was mildly affected, some compensatory changes were particularly necessary. This implied that impairment mechanism and compensation mechanism coexist among the SN-ECN connectivity in patients with MCI. Additionally, the IFG exhibited an aMCI-specific change for the SN-ECN connectivity in the FC in this study. The IFG, along with the hippocampus, drives encoding and retrieval of memory (Hampstead et al.,  ). This area also contributes to response inhibition, which is an important element in executive control (Jahanshahi et al.,  ). A study by He et al. reported significant differences in the internetwork FCs of the SN with the IFG in aMCI (He et al.,  ). Besides the SN-ECN connectivity, analyzing the FC of the DMN in aMCI revealed decreased FC between the DMN and the left IFG (Li et al.,  ). Thus, the abnormality of the IFG could be considered as one of the major factors contributing to the pathological mechanism of aMCI. Studies have also reported the gradient change in the FC of the ECN from aMCI to AD (Zhu et al.,  ). This further supports the abnormality of FC as a biomarker for monitoring disease progression. \n\nThe FC-altered interactions between SN and other networks, such as DMN and ECN, were mainly present in the prefrontal lobe (SFG, MFG, and IFG) (Petrelli et al.,  ). Studies have shown that when compared with HCs, the perfusion in the frontal lobe was significantly lower in MCI (Zhang et al.,  ). A recent study reported that following 12 weeks of exercise training, there was an increase in the FC in the prefrontal lobe and insular lobe in MCI (Chirles et al.,  ). A meta-analysis for target identification in the non-invasive brain stimulation of AD and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia demonstrated the core targets, including the MFG and SFG (Pievani et al.,  ). A systematic review of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) effects revealed that high-frequency rTMS, which targeted the left DLPFC, significantly improved the memory power (Chou et al.,  ). Thus, the prefrontal lobe, particularly the IFG in aMCI, can be a key target for intervention. \n\n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nThis meta-analysis had some limitations. First, the heterogeneity is the main limitation of this study and is due to the following four aspects: (1) data sources with different demographics of the subjects and acquisition parameters; (2) data quality, such as differences in motion correction and noise, affected the results; (3) data processing schemes including divergent preprocessing protocols, seed selection methods, and threshold settings; and (4) aberrant structural abnormalities, which were related to functional connectivity, were ignored in some studies. Second, besides the MCI group, we analyzed only the aMCI group. A meta-analysis based on naMCI was not conducted due to the inadequacy of the number of relative papers. Analysis of the subtype of MCI such as early MCI or later MCI is also neglected. Finally, we excluded the literature that was not published in English; hence, the data, which we have collected, might be incomplete. \n\n\n## Clinical Implications \n  \nAlthough amounts of single studies have been done to determine the characteristics of the SN of patients with MCI and its subtype, making quantitative neuroimaging analysis is needed to summarize the neurobiology of the SN in MCI and aMCI. Uniform and precious results determine more exact targets for moderate interventions such as drug, transcranial direct current stimulation, rTMS, deep brain stimulation, and proper functional training. Core brain regions, such as STG/insula, the left MFG, and IFG, can be considered as potential targets in patients with MCI or aMCI. At the same time, these brain areas are also regarded as focuses for follow-up to understand the effect of interventions and the pathogenesis of diseases. To sum up, our results strongly demonstrated the specific characteristics of affected brain areas and provided new insights for targeted treatment and follow-up care. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nBy conducting the ALE meta-analysis in patients with MCI and aMCI to identify the functional alterations about the SN, we have demonstrated the coexistence of impairment and compensation in the SN of patients with MCI, which is observed mainly in the SFG and the insula. Moreover, interactions of the SN with other networks, including changed the SN-DME connectivity and changed the SN-ECN connectivity, are also observed in MCI or aMCI. These findings can be a potential imaging biomarker for MCI or aMCI. Meanwhile, it has also provided a new insight in predicting the progression from a healthy state to MCI and novel targets for proper intervention to delay the further decline of cognitive function. Further research about MCI with comparisons between its subtypes needs to be carried out to explore more specific biomarkers for the predementia phase of AD. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nYS designed the study under the guidance of XL and JC.

Yet, findings from individual studies remain mixed. In the present quantitative functional neuroimaging meta-analysis, we summarized across 50 fMRI studies of social cognition to identify consistent differences in neural activation as a function of whether the target of social cognition was an in-group or out-group member. We investigated if such differences varied according to a specific social category (i.e. race) and specific social cognitive processes (i.e. empathy and emotion perception). We found that social cognition about in-group members was more reliably related to activity in brain regions associated with mentalizing (e.g. dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), whereas social cognition about out-group members was more reliably related to activity in regions associated with exogenous attention and salience (e.g. anterior insula). These findings replicated for studies specifically focused on the social category of race, and we further found intergroup differences in neural activation during empathy and emotion perception tasks. These results help shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition across group lines. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nFrom an early age, humans tend to categorize ourselves and others as \u2018us versus them\u2019 ( ;  ). These categorizations can lead individuals to enact disparate behaviors toward in-group and out-group members. For example, individuals tend to behave in ways that favor in-group members (i.e. in-group favoritism) and disfavor out-group members ( ;  ;  ). Such is the case when White individuals assign less harsh legal punishments to White (  vs   Black) targets ( ) or grant more comprehensive medical care to White patients compared to patients of other races ( ;  ). Further, perceptions of out-groups as more homogenous than one\u2019s in-group (i.e. out-group homogeneity effect) can also influence social behavior in intergroup interactions ( ;  ;  ;  ). This can manifest in the individuals\u2019 tendency to be less discerning in their perception of emotional expressions of out-group members ( ), which may engender discriminatory behavior via stereotyping and prejudice ( ). \n\nIt is clear from this behavioral literature that social categorizations matter: the ways in which we think about one another vary depending on perceived in-group   vs   out-group status ( ). Further, these differences in in-group   vs   out-group social cognition can underlie biased social behaviors ( ;  ;  ). However, it is less clear \u2018how\u2019 exactly an individual\u2019s group membership sets into action the neural processes that may ultimately mediate biased behavior. \n\n### Neuroscience of intergroup social cognition \n  \nNeuroimaging approaches have been widely used over the past two decades to address this \u2018how\u2019 by examining the neural mechanisms that underlie social cognitive processes directed toward in-group   vs   out-group members. For instance, consistent with the in-group favoritism effect, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data reveal greater activity in the ventral striatum for in-group members ( ) and more amygdala activity for out-group members ( ;  ), suggesting that in-group members may be perceived as more valuable and/or rewarding and out-group members might be more uncertain, ambiguous or aversive. Moreover, consistent with an out-group homogeneity effect, greater activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) for in-group members ( ;  ) and less activity in dmPFC for out-group members ( ) further underscore the fact that people may more likely attribute unique and rich mental qualities to in-group compared to out-group members. \n\nHowever, inconsistencies in the literature also abound, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the neural mechanisms underlying intergroup social cognition. For instance, some neuroimaging studies reveal greater insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation to out-group members during emotion perception tasks ( ;  ), whereas others show greater activity in these regions during in-group emotion perception ( ;  ;  ;  ). Similarly, some studies in which group membership is based on race find greater amygdala activation in response to \u2018out-group\u2019 faces, which may reflect other-race negativity bias ( ;  ;  ). However, neuroimaging studies involving social categorization based on minimal groups (e.g. red team   vs   blue team) have demonstrated greater amygdala activation in response to \u2018in-group\u2019 members ( ). These results suggest that the specific type of social grouping under consideration (i.e. race   vs   minimal group) may influence the neural regions engaged during social cognition across group lines ( ;  ). These inconsistencies are further complicated by the fact that individual neuroimaging studies are more prone to Type I errors due to small sample sizes and insufficient statistical corrections ( ). \n\nSince past studies in this area assess diverse social categories (e.g. race and minimal groups) and social cognitive processes (e.g. empathy and emotion perception), it is important to identify the core neural mechanisms underlying in-group and out-group social cognition across the literature. This is particularly important in light of the fact that it is not possible to make inferences about generalized intergroup neural processes from single studies that only investigate one type of social group (e.g. race). Further, while some studies offer evidence of the neural regions involved in generalized social categorization ( ;  ), still relatively little is known about how the brain distinguishes between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 more broadly. Meta-analysis is useful in this context because it allows us to identify the most reliable patterns of activation across several studies, regardless of the social category of distinction in any individual study. Further, this analytic tool overcomes the limitations associated with sample size, power and experimental design inherent in individual fMRI studies ( ;  ) to help reveal the functional neuroanatomy or \u2018neural reference space\u2019 consistently related to a process of interest (i.e. intergroup social cognition;  ). \n\nAdditionally, research needs to address how neural activity in intergroup contexts varies according to both the \u2018social category\u2019 assessed and \u2018social cognitive process\u2019 involved. Thus, we also aimed to use meta-analysis to identify how the neural mechanisms of intergroup social cognition may reliably vary as a function of a specific \u2018social category\u2019 (i.e. race) and two particular \u2018social cognitive processes\u2019 (i.e. empathy and emotion perception). We focused on \u2018race\u2019 as a key social category, given the importance of race-based bias in inter-race contexts ( ;  ) and the consequences of these behaviors on the health and well-being of marginalized racial group members ( ). Further, we focused on \u2018empathy\u2019 and \u2018emotion perception\u2019, given that these are two of the most studied processes in the intergroup social cognition fMRI literature ( ), and it is commonly argued that these social cognitive processes allow perceivers to represent the uniquely human experiences of group members that are important to intergroup relations ( ;  ). Investigating these in-group/out-group differences in the neural underpinnings of social cognition according to racial grouping and among the specific social cognitive processes of empathy and emotion perception will provide a more nuanced understanding of how group membership may shape behavior in intergroup contexts, especially in the case of race-based biases in social behavior. \n\n\n### The present study \n  \nIn sum, this meta-analysis addressed four primary questions: (i) Are a core set of brain regions reliably involved during social cognition across various \u2018social categories\u2019 and \u2018social cognitive processes\u2019? (ii) Do the neural correlates of in-group/out-group social cognition consistently differ when \u2018race\u2019 is the category on which the target\u2019s group membership is based? (iii) Does neural activation across in-group   vs   out-group consistently differ when \u2018empathy\u2019 and \u2018emotion perception\u2019 are the specific social cognitive processes engaged? (iv) Finally, within the specific social category of race, does neural activation consistently differ according to the specific social cognitive process engaged (i.e. empathy and emotion perception)? \n\nOur analysis expands upon a prior meta-analysis ( ) of \u223c30 studies which found that the amygdala, ACC, fusiform gyrus and right insula were reliably involved in distinguishing between in-group and out-group members generally. The current meta-analysis contains a total of 50 studies published through 2000\u20132018 and utilizes multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) as opposed to activation likelihood estimation technique used in  . Moreover, the present paper extends this prior work, which did not distinguish between a variety of social categories and types of social cognition, to examine the more specific neural correlates of intergroup social cognition for the social category of race and the specific social cognitive processes of empathy and emotion perception. \n\n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study selection and search strategy \n  \nFollowing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards ( ), our search strategy first collected relevant papers from PubMed and PsycINFO. We searched for English-language publications of fMRI studies that examined processing of in-group/out-group human targets. The initial search terms used were \u2018fMRI\u2009+\u2009in-group\u2009+\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018fMRI\u2009+\u2009group membership\u2019. We also used these terms in conjunction with various social categories to capture as many different in-group/out-groups as possible (see  ). \n\nTitles and abstracts of papers from these searches were reviewed to eliminate any clearly irrelevant studies or duplicates. The initial searches also resulted in several narrative review papers, which we mined for additional papers but excluded from the database of studies. Next, we completed full-text screening to eliminate studies that did not meet the following criteria: (i) participants were healthy, non-medicated adults; (ii) used fMRI to measure BOLD signal as an index of neural activity; (iii) coordinates of activation for contrasts were reported in either Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space and (iv) reported contrasts that directly compared processing of distinguishable in-group   vs   out-group (or vice versa) targets. We included both contrasts involving explicit processing of in-group/out-group distinctions (e.g. categorization of stimuli by group membership) and contrasts involving implicit processing of these distinctions (i.e. passive viewing of stimuli representing group membership). Coordinates for both region-of-interest and whole-brain analyses were included, consistent with prior MKDA approaches ( ;  ,  ;  ). These inclusion criteria resulted in a total of 50 papers in the final database, which together yielded 116 contrasts. See   for PRISMA diagram and   for characteristics of the included studies.\n \n  \nPRISMA diagram summarizing the literature search and study screening, eligibility and inclusion process. \n  \n\n### Data collection \n  \nData extraction was completed by two coders (i.e. the first and third authors), with each coder reviewing all articles separately. Thus, all studies were double-coded and cross-checked to identify discrepancies. If discrepancies were noted, both coders reviewed the article again to determine the accurate data to report. Each article was coded for the following elements: sample size, social cognitive process, stimuli (e.g. still face images and videos), social group (e.g. race, culture, gender and minimal), relational status of the target and reference (i.e. in-group or out-group), and coordinates of peak activation. \n\n\n\n## Data analysis \n  \nMKDA (see   for more information) was implemented through the Matlab toolbox NeuroElf ( ). Consistent with MKDA and neuroimaging meta-analytic procedures ( ;  ;  ), contrast coordinates in Talairach space were first converted to MNI space and then convolved using a smoothing kernel of 12\u2009mm, ultimately producing binary indicator contrast maps. Weights were placed on each study based on the square root of the sample size and whether the study used fixed or random effects. Fixed-effect studies were down-weighted by 0.75 to reduce the influence of those studies. By weighting studies in this manner, MKDA allows for higher-quality (i.e. higher powered and more generalizable) studies to have greater impact on the meta-analytic results ( ). The weighted averages of the kernels across individual study contrasts were used to produce contrast maps based on the proportion of activation near a given voxel from   N   contrasts. This proportion is thresholded by comparing it to a null distribution created through Monte Carlo simulations (5000 samples) that compute the likelihood of finding any activation in any voxel within gray matter (excluding white matter). For all analyses, we set this a priori threshold to a stringent height-based threshold of   p  \u2009<\u20090.001 (family-wise error-corrected for multiple comparisons) to determine whether voxels were significant. Results thus represent the neural regions displaying the most consistent activation for a given contrast (i.e. \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019) when averaged across all studies. \n\nFirst, we investigated the neural reference space of brain regions consistently activated during \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts across all study-level contrasts. Identifying these neural reference spaces allowed us to determine the core set of brain regions consistently associated with in-group   vs   out-group social cognition across the literature, regardless of the social cognitive process or group category studied. To supplement these primary contrasts, we also conducted meta-analytic contrasts in which we contrasted both of the aforementioned sets of contrasts against each other as follows:\n[(\u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019) > (\u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019)] and [(\u2018\u2009>\u2009in-group) > (in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019)]. These meta-analytic contrasts allowed us to determine which clusters of activation were relatively more consistent for \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 contrasts relative to \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts and vice versa. \n\nSecond, we examined the neural correlates of social cognition specifically for contrasts in which race was the social category of distinction. To do so, we investigated the neural reference space for each \u2018racial in-group\u2009>\u2009racial out-group\u2019 and \u2018racial out-group\u2009>\u2009racial in-group\u2019 contrast. Again, we supplemented these primary contrasts with meta-analytic contrasts, [(\u2018racial in-group\u2009>\u2009racial out-group\u2019) > (\u2018racial out-group\u2009>\u2009racial in-group\u2019)], to determine the relative specificity of activation for each contrast. \n\nThird, we examined how consistent differences in neural activation might differ based on the specific social cognitive process engaged. Thus, we investigated the neural reference space for \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 by specific social cognitive process. We focus in the main text on empathy and emotion perception, given their prevalence in the literature and importance for predicting biases in behavior ( ;  ;  ). Results for other social cognitive processes are presented in  . \n\nFinally, we examined the neural reference spaces for specific social cognitive processes (i.e. empathy and emotion perception) specifically within race-based contrasts. Results for other types of social cognition within race-specific contrasts are presented in  . \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Overall differences in functional activation for in-group   vs   out-group \n  \nWe first identified the neural reference space of regions more consistently activated for \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019, irrespective of task or social group (515/520 points; 115/116 contrasts). This analysis revealed consistent activity in the bilateral anterior insula, including a left anterior insula cluster (\u221236, 15, 10;   k  \u2009=\u2009260) that extended into the claustrum and a right anterior insula cluster (43, 20, 8;   k  \u2009=\u2009260) that extended into the right inferior frontal gyrus (iFG) and right precentral gyrus. A third cluster was centered in the right dmPFC (8, 47, 27;   k  \u2009=\u2009260), extending into the superior frontal gyrus. \n\nNext, we examined the neural reference space of regions more consistently activated for \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019, irrespective of task or social group (515/520 points; 115/116 contrasts). Here, we observed one significant cluster of activity, with its peak in the right anterior insula (33, 12, 13;   k  \u2009=\u20093060), extending into the right iFG and precentral gyrus. Thus, both the \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts revealed similar, but distinct, peaks in the anterior insula (see   and  ). \n  \nCoordinates for overall differences in functional activation for in-group   vs   out-group \n  \n Notes  : Brodmann\u2009=\u2009Brodmann area;   x  ,   y  ,   z  \u2009=\u2009coordinates in MNI space;   k  \u2009=\u2009cluster size in mm ; max\u2009=\u2009maximum value within a cluster; mean\u2009=\u2009average value within a cluster; LH\u2009=\u2009left hemisphere; RH\u2009=\u2009right hemisphere.

The [(\u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019)\u2009>\u2009(\u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019)] contrast revealed a significant cluster in the left dmPFC (0, 51, 36;   k  \u2009=\u2009100), while the [(\u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019)\u2009>\u2009(\u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019)] contrast revealed a significant cluster of activation in the right anterior insula (33, 12, 13;   k  \u2009=\u2009130) extending into the right iFG and precentral gyrus (see   and  ). \n  \nCoordinates for meta-analytics contrasts for overall in-group   vs   out-group \n  \n Notes  : in\u2009=\u2009in-group; out\u2009=\u2009out-group; Brodmann\u2009=\u2009Brodmann area;   x  ,   y  ,   z  \u2009=\u2009coordinates in MNI space;   k  \u2009=\u2009cluster size in mm ; max\u2009=\u2009maximum value within cluster; mean\u2009=\u2009average value within cluster; LH\u2009=\u2009left hemisphere; RH\u2009=\u2009right hemisphere.

The \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 analysis revealed a large swathe of activation in the superior frontal gyrus with its peak in the left dmPFC (0, 49, 32;   k  \u2009=\u2009100), bordering the left anterior medial PFC. The reverse contrast (i.e. \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group empathy\u2019; 64/520 points; 25/116 contrasts) showed three significant clusters of activation: one cluster in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; \u221244, 38, 13;   k  \u2009=\u2009256), a second cluster in the left premotor cortex (\u221227, 7, 50;   k  \u2009=\u2009260) and a third cluster in the right precentral gyrus extending into the right supplementary motor area (SMA; 43, 22, 40;   k  \u2009=\u2009250; see  ). \n  \nCoordinates for differences in functional activation for in-group   vs   out-group by social cognitive process \n  \n Notes  : Brodmann\u2009=\u2009Brodmann area;   x  ,   y  ,   z  \u2009=\u2009coordinates in MNI space;   k  \u2009=\u2009cluster size in mm ; max\u2009=\u2009maximum value within cluster; mean\u2009=\u2009average value within cluster; LH\u2009=\u2009left hemisphere; RH\u2009=\u2009right hemisphere.

For \u2018racial out-group emotion perception\u2009>\u2009racial in-group emotion perception\u2019 (112/520 points; 18/116 contrasts), there was one significant cluster in the right anterior insula (39, 20, 5;   k  \u2009=\u2009206; see   and  ). For written and tabular results for contrasts of other social cognitive processes, see   Results and  . \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \n### Overall differences in functional activation for in-group   vs   out-group \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, we examined the consistency and specificity of neural activation during intergroup social cognition. Results confirmed that there are consistent differences in neural activation during social cognition corresponding to whether the target of such cognition is an in-group   vs   out-group member. Across studies that engaged a variety of social cognitive processes and defined group membership based on diverse social categories, we found more consistent activation in prefrontal cortical regions including the right iFG, precentral gyrus and dmPFC when social cognition was directed at in-group (  vs   out-group) members. Moreover, meta-analytic contrasts indicated that the dmPFC was more consistently activated across study contrasts of \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 compared to \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 social cognition. Interestingly, the anterior insula was part of the neural reference space for social cognition regardless of whether the target of social cognition was an in-group or out-group member. However, subsequent meta-analytic contrasts revealed that although the anterior insula was consistently active across both \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 and \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts, this region was \u2018more consistently\u2019 activated for \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 social cognitive processing relative to \u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019 across studies. \n\nOur overall in-group   vs   out-group findings offer some insight into neurocognitive processes that may underlie intergroup social behavior. For example, more consistent dmPFC activation during in-group (  vs   out-group) social cognition aligns with behavioral theories, suggesting that individuals are more likely to assign mental states to and act prosocially toward in-group compared to out-group members ( ;  ;  ), as dmPFC activity has been consistently associated with the ability to infer mental states of others ( ;  ;  ) and has been implicated in prosocial behavior ( ;  ). Further, research shows that the ability to simulate the minds of others tends to lead to greater prosocial behavior ( ). Notably, this consistent dmPFC activation for in-group relative to out-group members may seem surprising in light of existing literature suggesting a ventral\u2013dorsal gradient in the mPFC, with the dmPFC implicated in social cognitive processing of dissimilar (e.g. out-group) others and the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) implicated in processing of similar (e.g. in-group) others ( ;  ). However, other studies have offered evidence that such ventral\u2013dorsal distinctions of the mPFC maybe be task-dependent (see   for a review). Although the present analyses were not specifically intended to test the presence of a ventral\u2013dorsal gradient in the mPFC, our results raise further questions about whether this gradient observed for some tasks generalizes across social cognition more broadly. As such, future work should explore this question more directly. Nevertheless, findings of the present study appear consistent with the notion that individuals are more likely to engage in mentalizing for in-group (  vs   out-group) members and that doing so may promote greater prosocial behavior ( ;  ), thus offering a potential neural mechanism underlying in-group favoritism. \n\nOur finding of more consistent anterior insula activation during out-group social cognition also offers insight into the neural mechanisms that may underly out-group biases identified in the behavioral literature. Existing meta-analytic evidence suggests two major functional\u2013anatomic subregions within the anterior insula: the ventral region, shown to be more active during visceral and affective experiences (especially subjective arousal), and the dorsal region, which is more associated with exogenous attention, including salience detection, attention orientation and task performance monitoring ( ;  ,  ,  ). Given these distinctions, one interpretation of the present findings is that out-group social cognition demands more attentional resources relative to in-group social cognition, perhaps because out-group members are more unfamiliar, infrequent or novel. This interpretation also corresponds with previous functional connectivity analyses that have shown evidence of anterior insula laterality during orientating/arousal and tasks requiring cognitive control. Specifically, right anterior insula has shown stronger connectivity with regions implicated in attentional orientation and arousal (e.g. postcentral gyrus and supramarginal gyrus), while left anterior insula shows stronger connectivity with regions implicated in perspective taking and cognitive motor control (e.g. dmPFC and superior frontal gyrus;  ). Along these lines, the right lateralization of anterior insula for out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group processing may reflect recruitment of attentional resources that results in focus on an individual\u2019s salient out-group status, rather than individuating processes associated with greater medial prefrontal activation. On the other hand, the left lateralization of the anterior insula during in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group processing may facilitate communication with regions involved in perspective taking and mentalizing processes that allow for more individuated perceptions of in-group members. However, such interpretations are made cautiously given evidence, suggesting that functional lateralization of the anterior insula may vary with age, gender and other individual differences, and we were unable to account for these differences in the current analyses ( ;  ). \n\nInterestingly, the \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 anterior insula findings also align with recent neuroimaging work showing that the right anterior insula is involved in integrating information about how others relate to one another in the service of making social group inferences ( ). For instance, in  , predictions about allyship among group members based on latent structure learning of social group coalitions were related to greater activation of the right anterior insula, compared to when predictions of allyship were based solely on similarity between targets. As such, the consistent anterior insula activation observed in our \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019 contrasts may suggest that, when considering out-group members, people engage in an additional layer of processing that incorporates how members of that out-group relate to other groups but do not engage in this same degree of processing when thinking about in-group members. \n\n\n### Differences in functional activation for racial in-group   vs   racial out-group \n  \nWe also investigated whether there are consistent neural differences in intergroup social cognition specifically within the social category of race. Interestingly, we did not find any regions consistently activated during racial in-group (  vs   out-group) social cognition. However, racial out-group (  vs   in-group) social cognitive processing was associated with more frequent activation of the mFG. We also found consistent anterior insula activation during racial out-group (  vs   in-group) social cognitive processing, mirroring the pattern of activation observed in the overall contrasts (i.e. \u2018out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group\u2019). A subsequent meta-analytic contrast comparing [(\u2018racial out-group\u2009>\u2009racial in-group\u2019)\u2009>\u2009(\u2018racial in-group\u2009>\u2009racial out-group\u2019)] revealed a significant cluster of activation in the right anterior insula that also closely mirrored the findings of the overall [(\u2018out-group in-group\u2019)\u2009>\u2009(\u2018in-group\u2009>\u2009out-group\u2019)] meta-analytic contrast, suggesting that the swathe of activation in this region may be associated with out-group processing in general, rather than being specific to racial out-group processing. Alternatively, this finding could be attributable to race being the most frequently investigated social category in the current literature, thus causing race-specific findings to drive an overall meta-analytic effect. \n\nOur failure to identify consistent activation during racial in-group social cognition is interesting and suggests that there is heterogeneity in the brain areas underlying social cognition for racial in-group members across the literature. There were 80 contrasts in our database that addressed this particular question, so our failure to find consistent activation is not likely due to a lack of power. Indeed, a review of the individual contrast maps that contributed to these results revealed that the clusters of activation from individual studies were spatially heterogeneous, suggesting that the null results of these contrasts are driven by true variability in the data rather than due to lack of power. As such, one interpretation of these results is that social cognition for racial in-group members may be so routine that it does not preferentially activate brain regions above and beyond those activated for racial out-group members. In contrast, we did find that social cognitive processing directed at racial out-group individuals consistently elicits increased activity in regions implicated in exogenous attention and salience (e.g. anterior insula, mFG and iFG), mirroring findings for out-group members more generally and suggesting some consistency in regions involved in racial out-group social cognition across the literature. \n\n\n### Differences in functional activation for overall in-group   vs   out-group and racial in-group   vs   out-group by social cognitive process \n  \nFinally, we explored how functional activation during intergroup processing may vary depending on the social cognitive process engaged, focusing specifically on empathy and emotion perception. We found empathy directed at in-group members was associated with more consistent activation in the dmPFC, even when focused specifically on racial in-group (  vs   out-group) empathy. Among racial in-group (  vs   out-group) empathy contrasts, we also observed a significant cluster of activation centered on the anterior insula. This cluster was more dorsal, which, in following with the ventral\u2013dorsal distinctions of anterior insula functionality ( ;  ), suggests that empathy for in-group members may be more salient or elicit stronger attentional control (compared to out-group). However, these findings are difficult to interpret considering that our earlier results indicated that the anterior insula was more consistently activated in response to out-group members when we collapsed contrasts across all social cognition tasks. Still, this empathy-specific finding might suggest that in-group/out-group differences in activation of the dorsal anterior insula depend on the particular social cognitive process engaged. Conversely, empathy directed at out-group members was consistently associated with activity in motor (e.g. premotor cortex and precentral gyrus) and executive function areas (e.g. dlPFC and mFG) of the prefrontal cortex, perhaps suggesting that more effortful cognitive control is necessary to engage in empathy for out-group members. \n\nWe also observed differences in neural activation in response to racial in-group   vs   out-group members (although not to in-group   vs   out-group members in general) during emotion perception tasks. Specifically, perceiving emotions of racial in-group members was associated with activation in the amygdala and fusiform, regions that have been well-established in visual emotion perception ( ;  ;  ), while emotion perception directed at racial out-group members was related to consistent anterior insula activation. Interestingly, this cluster was relatively more ventral than those observed in other out-group\u2009>\u2009in-group contrasts. One interpretation of this finding is that it may reflect greater aversive affective responding on the part of perceivers ( ,  ), as perceivers may find emotional racial out-group members to be aversive. Again, these findings related to the activation of the anterior insula in these empathy and emotion perception contrasts remain difficult to interpret and warrant future studies to better understand how the ventral\u2013dorsal anterior insula is operating in in-group   vs   out-group empathy and emotion perception. Nonetheless, these task-specific findings ultimately indicate that the neural correlates of intergroup social cognition do indeed vary depending on the specific social cognitive process engaged. This variation appears to be especially true for affective tasks like empathy and emotion perception, which would explain the inconsistencies noted in the literature regarding insula and dACC activity during in-group   vs   out-group social cognitive processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\n\n### Limitations and future directions \n  \nThis work has some limitations. Data were constrained to published fMRI studies; therefore, it is unclear how the present results may be affected by publication bias. Moreover, the race-specific contrasts do not address how neural responding may vary depending on the specific racial groups involved (e.g. Black   vs   White and Asian   vs   Black). Distinguishing among various types of cross-race dyads is an important future direction, as different dynamics (e.g. cultural stereotypes and intergroup histories) exist for different racial/ethnic group pairings. Furthermore, due to a limited number of eligible studies, we were unable to assess in-group   vs   out-group differences in neural activation across all types of social cognition and social categories, thus leaving unanswered questions about other notable social cognitive processes such as theory of mind and perceptions of trustworthiness. \n\nFinally, while our results may offer insight into neural mechanisms underlying intergroup social behaviors, they are subject to important caveats inherent in any neuroimaging meta-analysis. First, coordinate-based neuroimaging meta-analyses are the gold standard when aggregating across the neuroimaging literature; yet, these techniques rely on functional coordinates derived from contrast analyses but do not incorporate coordinates derived from correlational or functional connectivity analyses, thus limiting the kinds of studies that can be included in the database. Nonetheless, this meta-analysis helps reveal which regions are most consistently active for different social cognitive processes and targets, which may in turn prove useful for future studies using more advanced techniques such as functional connectivity. Second, interpretation of meta-analytic neuroimaging data is subject to reverse inference\u2014inferring cognitive processes from the presence of neural activation ( ). Future studies should follow up on these interpretations using experimental designs that pinpoint brain\u2013behavior links. Finally, our findings do not provide evidence of a causal link between neural activation and subsequent behavior in intergroup contexts. Future research might explore how inducing neural activity in the regions identified here may impact individuals\u2019 behaviors when directed at in-group   vs   out-group members. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe conducted the largest meta-analysis to date of the fMRI literature examining the neural correlates of social cognition across group lines. Our findings align with existing behavioral data and theories on intergroup social phenomena (e.g. in-group favoritism and out-group degradation) and help clarify how the brain gives rise to diverse social cognitive processes, which in turn may manifest as biased social behaviors in intergroup contexts. We hope this work can help guide future research and interventions that address intergroup behavioral dynamics. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8421705, "text_md5": "112310c524b3950dba9ea0643970cdca", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 116], "journal": [117, 141], "publication_year": [143, 147], "title": [158, 236], "keywords": [250, 307], "abstract": [320, 1739], "body": [1748, 41812]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33760100, "doi": "10.1093/scan/nsab034", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421705", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8421705"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421705\">8421705</a>", "list_title": "PMC8421705  The neural underpinnings of intergroup social cognition: an fMRI meta-analysis"}

NSCLC patients with locoregional disease are generally treated with curative surgery or radiotherapy with/without chemotherapy.  In contrast, palliative chemotherapy or molecule-targeted treatment is the standard treatment for NSCLC patients with metastasis. \n\nConventional imaging procedure for distant metastasis staging of lung cancer is the combination of computed tomography, bone scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and its accuracy is still unsatisfactory. \u2013 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( F-FDG PET/CT) can detect the increase in glucose metabolism in tumor cells and offer anatomical details at the same time, enabling whole-body examination in a single procedure.  Although many previous studies about  F-FDG PET/CT have been reported for distant metastasis staging in NSCLC patients at initial staging, \u2013  the results among studies are still controversial. Here, we undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of  F-FDG PET/CT for detecting distant metastasis in NSCLC patients at initial staging. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Search strategy \n  \nWe searched for studies evaluating  F-FDG PET/CT for the detection of distant metastasis in NSCLC patients at initial staging. Articles were identified with a search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases through October 29, 2017. We used a search algorithm that was based on a combination of text words: PET/CT, positron emission tomography/computed tomography, PET-CT, positron emission tomography-computed tomography, non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC, staging, and distant metastasis. We had no language restrictions for searching and selecting relevant studies. References of pertinent articles (the retrieved articles, meta-analysis, reviews, and editorials) and guidelines were also screened manually to retrieve additional eligible studies. Authors of eligible studies were contacted and asked to supplement additional data when key information was missing. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nWe included studies based on the following criteria: 1)  F-FDG PET/CT was used as a diagnostic tool for the detection of distant metastases in NSCLC patients at initial staging; 2) studies can provide sufficient data of the true-positive, false-negative, false-positive, and true-negative values to reconstruct a 2\u00d72 table; 3) studies with a minimal sample size of 10 patients were included; 4) studies were based on a per-patient analysis; and 5) pathological analysis and/or imaging follow-up data served as the reference standard. \n\nWe excluded studies based on the following criteria: 1) studies enrolled patients with recurrent NSCLC; 2) studies enrolled patients with NSCLC and small cell lung cancer, if relevant data regarding the NSCLC patients could not be obtained; 3) studies came from the same study group; and 4) non-original articles (case reports, conference abstracts, and reviews). \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nTwo reviewers extracted data from eligible studies independently and resolved discrepancies by discussion. For each report, we recorded the author names, publication time, country of origin, sample size, technical protocols of PET\u2013CT (technical parameters, interpreters, criteria for defining positive PET/CT results), reference standards, and follow-up time. For each study, we also recorded the number of true-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative values for  F-FDG PET/CT. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nTo evaluate the quality, two reviewers independently evaluated the methodological quality of all included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 (QUADAS-2) tool.  It consists of four key domains covering patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nAll analyses were conducted with Stata version 12.0 (Stata-Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA). We used the bivariate regression model to obtain weighted overall estimates of the sensitivity and specificity as the main outcome measures and to construct summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves for  F-FDG PET/CT. ,  By using the pooled sensitivity and specificity, we also calculated diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), positive likelihood ratios (PLRs), and negative likelihood ratios (NLRs) for  F-FDG PET/CT. \u2013 \n\nWe used the summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity to calculate the negative predictive values of  F-FDG PET/CT when the prevalence of distant metastasis in NSCLC was assumed to be 10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively. \n\nThe Deeks\u2019 funnel plot was used to assess publication bias. An asymmetric Deeks\u2019 funnel plot (  p   < 0.05) would suggest that a publication bias is present. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Eligible studies \n  \nThe electronic search yielded 2460 articles; 2438 were excluded upfront by reading the abstract because they did not present any diagnostic information. We screened in full text 22 articles and rejected 12; 10 articles \u2013 , \u2013  were eligible for meta-analysis. Reasons for exclusion are listed in  . Ten of the 10 (100%) studies stated that they were prospective (Prosp). A total of 10 studies (1333 patients) were analyzed for the accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT to detect distant metastases ( ). In four studies,  F-FDG PET/CT was interpreted in a qualitative (QL) manner, whereas in six studies, it was interpreted in a quantitative and QL manner. \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nThe results of the quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool are shown in  . The risk of bias and applicability concerns with regard to patient selection were unclear or low in three of all 10 studies. , ,  Risk of bias with regard to the index test was low in all 10 studies because the PET\u2013CT results were consistently interpreted without knowledge of the reference standard results. However, the risk of bias for the reference standard was high in all 10 studies because the reference standard was not executed without knowledge of the PET\u2013CT results. \n\n\n### Results of meta-analysis \n  \n#### Summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, DOR, PLR, and NLR \n  \n shows the forest plot of sensitivity and specificity for  F-FDG PET/CT in NSCLC patients at initial M staging. When considering 10 studies (1333 patients), the pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, PLR, and NLR for  F-FDG PET/CT were 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.63\u20130.92), 0.96 (95% CI = 0.94\u20130.98), 117 (95% CI = 38\u2013355), 22.9 (95% CI = 13.3\u201339.5), and 0.20 (95% CI = 0.09\u20130.42), respectively. \n\n\n#### SROC curve \n  \nThe SROC curve for  F-FDG PET/CT in NSCLC patients at initial M staging is shown in  . The results showed that the overall weighted area under the SROC curve was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.96\u20130.98). \n\n\n\n### Negative predictive values \n  \nAssuming a prevalence of distant metastases of 10%, 20%, and 30% in NSCLC patients, the negative predictive values for  F-FDG PET-CT were 0.98, 0.95, and 0.92, respectively. \n\n\n### Publication bias \n  \nThe publication bias for  F-FDG PET/CT (  p   = 0.38 > 0.05) was insignificant. The funnel plot for  F-FDG PET/CT was symmetrical ( ). These results indicated that the publication bias was not statistically significant. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nDistant metastasis staging is one of the major prognostic factors of survival in NSCLC patients. Accurate staging of distant metastasis is crucial, as the treatment strategy is directly dependent on tumor stage.  In this meta-analysis of 10 studies, distant metastasis involves 239 of 1333 (17.9%) eligible patients.  F-FDG PET/CT has a sensitivity and a specificity of 0.81 (95% CI = 0.63\u20130.92) and 0.96 (95% CI = 0.94\u20130.98), respectively. This meta-analysis documents that  F-FDG PET/CT has a good diagnostic performance for NSCLC patients at initial M staging. With the application of PET\u2013CT in initial M staging of NSCLC, distant metastases may be detected earlier. This would have a considerable impact on patient staging of distant metastasis and the execution of more reliable treatment protocols. \n\nAs one of the best indicators of diagnostic meta-analysis, the likelihood ratio is widely considered to be more important than sensitivity and specificity. \u2013  In this meta-analysis, the PLR value of 22.9 suggested that the correct probability of testing the positivity of the PET\u2013CT assay in NSCLC patients with distant metastasis would be ~23 times higher than that in patients without distant metastasis. The NLR value of 0.09 indicated that the incorrect probability of testing the negativity of the PET\u2013CT assay in NSCLC patients with distant metastasis would be 0.20 times lower than that in patients without distant metastasis. In other words, the correct probability of testing the negativity of the PET\u2013CT assay in NSCLC patients without distant metastasis would be approximately five (1/0.20) times higher than that in patients with distant metastasis. \n\nThe SROC curve has been recommended to represent the performance of a diagnostic meta-analysis, which indicates the balance between sensitivity and specificity to compare diagnostic values from different diagnostic tests. ,  The SROC curve showed that the overall weighted area under the curve was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.96\u20130.98), suggesting that  F-FDG PET/CT has an excellent accuracy for the initial M staging of NSCLC patients. \n\nNevertheless, the present study has several limitations that should be considered. First, the exclusion of unpublished studies and meeting abstracts was probably a cause of publication bias. Second, the reference standard of the pathological analysis was not obtained from all distant metastatic lesions, which may affect the accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT. Third, we did not perform subgroup analyses according to clinical stage and subtype of pathology because this would have required individual patient data. Clinical stage and subtype of pathology may influence the probability of distant metastases, which may also affect the diagnostic accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT. Fourth, there is a unified protocol of PET/CT (technical parameters, interpreters, criteria for defining positive PET/CT results). The optimal accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT for distant metastasis staging in NSCLC patients is still unclear. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nF-FDG PET/CT has excellent diagnostic performance for the detection of distant metastases in NSCLC patients. Large and Prosp studies with a standardized protocol of  F-FDG PET/CT are needed to investigate the optimal value of  F-FDG PET/CT and could help establish  F-FDG PET/CT as an accurate tool for distant metastasis staging in NSCLC. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6037269, "text_md5": "f0e7c76856f212cbb63e1d687b4caf4c", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 96], "journal": [97, 113], "publication_year": [115, 119], "title": [130, 287], "keywords": [301, 361], "abstract": [374, 1469], "body": [1478, 12322]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 30013392, "doi": "10.2147/CMAR.S155542", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6037269", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6037269"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6037269\">6037269</a>", "list_title": "PMC6037269  Clinical usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/CT for the detection of distant metastases in patients with non-small cell lung cancer at initial staging: a meta-analysis"}

The aim of this article is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to estimate the performance of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( F-FDG PET/CT) for the diagnosis of native valve endocarditis (NVE). Methods: Selected articles evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT in patients with suspected NVE, resulting from a comprehensive literature search through the PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane library databases until April 2020, were included for the systematic review and meta-analysis. Results: Seven studies (351 episodes of suspected NVE) were included.  F-FDG PET/CT yielded a pooled sensitivity of 36.3% and a pooled specificity of 99.1% for the diagnosis of NVE. The pooled positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio were 8.3, 0.6, and 15.3, respectively. The sensitivity increased using contemporary PET/CT device with state-of-the-art patient preparation as well as innovative image acquisitions or adding the results of  F-FDG PET/CT in a multimodality strategy. Conclusions: In our systematic review and meta-analysis,  F-FDG PET/CT yielded a poor pooled sensitivity with an otherwise excellent pooled specificity for the diagnosis of NVE; however, several factors may increase the sensitivity without affecting the specificity and these factors should be better evaluated in future studies. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nInfective endocarditis (IE) is a multisystem infectious disease affecting the damaged endocardial surface of the heart valve as well as the surface of an indwelling cardiac device [ ]. It was first described as a pathological infectious process in 1885 by Sir William Osler [ ]. It is a relatively rare disease, with a prevalence ranging from 1.5 to 11.6 cases per 100,000 person-years [ ]. IE occurs in more than half of cases in the native valve [ ] and it remains a life-threatening disease despite the improvement in diagnosis and therapy, with contemporary mortality rates up to 25% [ ]. The diagnosis of native valve endocarditis (NVE) is based on the presence of positive blood cultures and evidence of endocardial involvement in echocardiography as major criteria [ ]. However, using the Duke criteria (DC) alone leads to about 24% misclassification of patients with proven IE to possible IE, especially by negative blood culture endocarditis [ ]. This is of clinical importance, since delay in the diagnosis and thus initiation of an appropriate treatment results in poorer clinical outcome [ ]. Therefore, further strategies for prompt and accurate diagnosis are still needed. \n\nIn recent years, promising studies on the role of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( F-FDG PET/CT) in the diagnosis of active inflammatory and infectious processes in patients with fever of unknown origin, with endovascular prosthesis and implantable pacemaker/defibrillators have been published [ ]. Moreover, the potential of this technique to diagnose prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) [ ] has also been investigated. This investigation tool relies on the increase glycolytic activity of inflammatory cells following pathogen invasion, allowing their visualization by  F-FDG PET/CT [ ]. Based on accumulating evidence,  F-FDG PET/CT has been included as a new major criterion for PVE in the modified Duke criteria (mDC) endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology in 2015 [ ]. However, the evidence is not in favor of the use of this technique for the diagnosis of NVE due to its limited sensitivity [ ]. \n\nNew evidence on the value of  F-FDG PET/CT in IE has been published in over the last few years. Some of these studies were pooled in three systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses with mixed population of IE patients [ , , ]. We perform this systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the current value of  F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of NVE only. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \nThe authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the \u201cPreferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies\u201d (PRISMA-DTA statement), a guideline which describes the items required for reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy studies [ ]. \n\n### 2.1. Search Strategy \n  \nWe performed a comprehensive computer literature search through PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane library databases for published studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT in patients with suspected NVE until April 27, 2020. For this purpose, a search algorithm based on a combination of terms was created and used: (A) \u201cPET\u201d OR \u201cpositron\u201d OR \u201cFDG\u201d AND (B) \u201cendocarditis\u201d. There were no date limit nor language restrictions applied to the database search. Moreover, in order to achieve a more comprehensive search, we also manually screened the references of the selected articles. \n\n\n### 2.2. Study Selection \n  \nTitles and abstracts of the records obtained by using our search strategy were independently screened by two reviewers (C.K. and G.T.) based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were original articles reporting information on the diagnostic performance of  F-FDG PET/CT in NVE. Exclusion criteria were: (a) reviews, editorials, comments related to the review question; (b) case reports related to the review question; (c) articles outside the field of interest of this review (including those focused on the role of  F-FDG PET/CT in detecting PVE or extra-cardiac foci of IE). The full text of letters and original articles which were related to the review question was independently screened to assess for their inclusion for both the systematic review and the meta-analysis. From these selected articles, those who did not provide sufficient data to reassess the sensitivity and specificity of  F-FDG PET/CT in NVE were excluded from the meta-analysis. In the case of data overlap, all the selected articles were included in the systematic review, whereas only the article with the most complete information was included in the meta-analysis. Disagreements were solved through a consensus meeting between both reviewers. \n\n\n### 2.3. Data Extraction \n  \nFor each included study, data were extracted by two reviewers (C.K. and G.T.), including general information on study characteristics (authors name, year of publication, country, study design), patient characteristics (age, sex ratio, type and number of patients evaluated, clinical and biological findings), technical details (patient preparation protocol,  F-FDG injected activity, time interval between radiotracer injection and image acquisition, acquisition of delayed images, and protocol for the image analysis). Moreover, data on the diagnostic accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT on a per patient-based analysis (including true positive and true negative findings, false positive and false negative findings, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, diagnostic accuracy), name of the most common microbiological pathogen involved in NVE and information about the extent of the infection were also collected. For some articles, extraction of data from available figures, followed by mathematic calculations, was needed to calculate the diagnostic value of  F-FDG PET/CT. \n\n\n### 2.4. Quality Assessment \n  \nThe quality of the included studies was assessed according to the revised \u201cQuality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies\u201d tool (QUADAS-2) by 2 independent investigators (C.K. and G.T.). Of note, QUADAS-2 includes four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. Each domain was assessed in terms of risk of bias, and also in terms of concerns regarding applicability (except the flow and timing domain for this latest) [ ]. Any discrepancies in the quality assessment were solved by consensus. \n\n\n### 2.5. Statistical Analysis \n  \nOn a per patient-based analysis, accuracy data (true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative) were extracted from each study to assess the pooled sensitivity and specificity, using a bivariate random-effects model for statistical pooling of data, which takes into account any possible correlation between sensitivity and specificity. Further diagnostic measures were calculated, including positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR\u2013) as well as diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). A random-effects model was also used for statistical pooling of LR+, LR\u2013, as well as DOR. Pooled data were given with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and displayed using forest plots. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-square index (I ). Statistical analyses were performed using OpenMeta [Analyst]  software (version 0.1503) funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (Rockville, Maryland, United States). \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Literature Search \n  \nA total of 340 records were identified through the comprehensive electronic database search of PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane library databases. Overall, 327 records were excluded: 254 as not in the field of interest, 46 as reviews, editorials, or letters, and 27 as case reports. Thus, 13 articles were eligible for full-text screening. No pertinent studies were added after screening the references of these articles. After full-text screening, six articles were excluded from the systematic review as well as from the meta-analysis, because of missing information to assess both sensitivity and specificity of  F-FDG PET/CT. Therefore, seven articles with a total of 351 episodes of suspected NVE were included in the qualitative (systematic review) as well as in the quantitative analysis (meta-analysis) [ , , , , , , ].   summarizes the literature search results. \n\n\n### 3.2. Qualitative Analysis (Systematic Review) \n  \n#### 3.2.1. Basic Study and Patient Characteristics \n  \na,b summarize the main characteristics of the included studies. Of note, the selected studies were mostly performed in Europe, except for two which were performed in North America [ ] and South America [ ]. There were all monocentric and mostly prospective, except for two retrospective studies [ , ]. The articles were published between 2016 and 2020. Five studies included a total of 722 episodes with clinical suspicion of IE, with a subgroup of 209 episodes with suspected NVE [ , , , , ]. Two studies were exclusively dedicated to assess the accuracy of  F-FDG PET/CT in 142 patients with clinical suspected NVE [ , ]. In six studies, the mean age of the patients ranged from 58 to 71 years with a proportion of 68.1% of males, whereas corresponding data could not be assessed in one study [ ]. Two studies reported the percentage of positive echocardiographic findings, ranging from 19% to 42% [ , ]. These two studies reported a rate of positive blood culture of 52% and 100% of the study population, partly because only blood culture positive patients were included in the second study by Kouijzer et al. [ ]. A third study reported a 74% rate of positive blood culture [ ]. Two studies reported the presence of fever in about 70% of their study population [ , ], with a C-reactive protein (CRP) mean value of 78.5 mg/L in one of these studies [ ], similar to the CRP mean value of another study [ ]. Most patients were treated with antibiotics prior to  F-FDG PET/CT, with a mean duration of treatment ranging from 7 to 30 days [ , , , ]. \n\n\n#### 3.2.2. Technical Aspects \n  \na,b summarize the technical aspects of  F-FDG PET/CT in the included studies. In all studies, the physiological myocardial  F-FDG uptake suppression was obtained through high-fat low-carbohydrate (HFLC) diet for 12 to 24 h and at least 6 to 8 h prolonged fasting prior administration of  F-FDG. Moreover, a bolus of unfractionated heparin (50 IU/kg) was injected, when not contraindicated [ , , ]. No indication about heparin administration was given in four studies [ , , , ]. The images were acquired 60 min after administration of  F-FDG in the vast majority of studies, except for one, where the images were performed earlier at 45 min [ ]. Four studies used a Biograph mCT hybrid PET/CT (Siemens) [ , , , ] with different technical performance, and one used a Gemini-TF hybrid PET/CT (Philips) [ ]. No information about the type of hybrid device was given in two studies [ , ]. The mean injected activity ranged from 3 to 5 MBq/kg in four studies [ , , , ]. A fixed dose of 370 MBq was administered in two studies [ , ]. The images were visually assessed in all studies by two experienced physicians, all blinded to the patient clinical information. In two studies, involvement of a third experienced physician was required in case of disagreement [ , ]. For the vast majority of studies, a focal or heterogeneous  F-FDG uptake greater than the surrounding tissue, after exclusion of potential residual physiological myocardial activity, was used as positive criterion [ , , , , ]. Two studies considered any increased  F-FDG uptake in the native heart valve as a positive criterion [ , ]. In addition, visual assessment was standardized using a scoring system in two studies [ , ]. Three studies used in addition to the visual analysis a semi-quantitative assessment of the  F-FDG uptake, i.e., through the calculation of the maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) [ , , ]. \n\n\n#### 3.2.3. Main Findings \n  \na,b summarize the diagnostic performance of  F-FDG PET/CT in patients suspected of NVE in the included studies, whereas   illustrates the overall quality assessment of these studies. No adverse effects were reported in any of the patients after  F-FDG administration. In most of the included studies, we observed a poor sensitivity of  F-FDG PET/CT in patients with suspected NVE, except for one recent study with improved sensitivity by 67.7% [ ]. In contrast, the specificity of  F-FDG PET/CT was excellent in all included studies, reaching 100% in four studies. The diagnostic accuracy ranged from 61.8% to 85.2%. \n\nThe most common microbiological pathogens found in blood cultures were Gram-positive bacteria from the Staphylococcus species, followed by Streptococcus species and Enterococcus species. Due to the acquisition from the base of the skull to at least the mid-tights in all the studies, it was possible to assess for the presence of metastatic foci. These were reported in the majority of studies in patients with confirmed NVE, in up to 54.5% of the patients [ ]. Alternative diagnoses, such as systemic inflammatory diseases or neoplastic diseases, were reported in the majority of studies in patients with rejected diagnosis of NVE, in up to 45% of the patients [ ]. These studies, except one [ ], also reported alternative foci of infections. It should be mentioned that the exact percentage of metastatic foci and alternative diagnosis in patients with confirmed or rejected diagnosis of NVE could not be extracted for all the included studies, since these data were given for the mixed population of PVE and NVE rather than specifically for the NVE population. All studies used, as gold standard for the diagnosis of IE, the decision of a multidisciplinary endocarditis team (MET), applying the mDC while integrating clinical, imaging, and microbiological findings. Three studies used, additionally in the final decision, the histological analyses of the valve tissue obtained after surgery [ , , ]. Three studies excluded the  F-FDG PET/CT findings from the final decision [ , , ], whereas four studies integrated them in the final decision [ , , , ]. \n\nTwo from seven studies [ , ] reported false positive cases. False negative cases were reported in all studies, ranging from 32% to even 100%; this latest in a study with limited number of patients [ ]. One study reported incomplete  F-FDG myocardial suppression as a potential cause of the false negative findings [ ]. Two studies did not report any significant difference in the performance of  F-FDG PET/CT between different groups based on the duration of antibiotic treatment [ , ], whereas one study reported the administration of antibiotics in the vast majority of patients with false negative results [ ]. \n\nEchocardiography performed globally better than  F-FDG PET/CT in the majority of studies [ , , ]. Two studies reported a better performance of  F-FDG PET/CT compared to the mDC [ , ]. However, in one study, only transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and not transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed in the majority of patients with the diagnosis of possible or rejected NVE [ ]. Two studies reported a greater size of the vegetation in patients with positive  F-FDG PET/CT findings [ , ]. When adding  F-FDG PET/CT as major and minor criterion in the mDC, we observed a significant improvement of the mDC sensitivity up to 78% (95%CI 66\u201390%), without excellent specificity by up to 91% (95%CI 85\u201398), as reported in two studies [ , ]. \n\n\n\n### 3.3. Quantitative Analysis (Meta-Analysis) \n  \nSeven studies with 351 episodes of suspected NVE were included for the bivariate meta-analysis [ , , , , , , ]. Results of the meta-analysis are presented in  ,  , and  . The sensitivity of  F-FDG PET/CT in patients with suspected NVE ranged from 22% to 67.7%, with a pooled estimate of 36.3% (95%CI: 21.8\u201353.9%). The specificity of  F-FDG PET/CT in patients with suspected NVE ranged from 84.6% to 100% with a pooled estimate of 99.1% (95%CI: 88.6\u201399.9%). The pooled LR+, LR\u2212, and DOR were 8.3 (95%CI: 3.7\u201318.3), 0.6 (95%CI: 0.27\u20131.33), and 15.3 (95%CI: 6.14\u201338.38), respectively. No significant statistical heterogeneity among the studies was found for all the metrics evaluated (  I   = 0%). \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThree recent systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses have questioned the performance of  F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of IE [ , , ]. In recent years, several articles assessing the diagnostic performance of  F-FDG PET/CT in NVE became available. To better understand the potential role of  F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of NVE, we pooled the results from several studies to increase the statistical power. \n\nIn this meta-analysis of seven mostly prospective studies including 351 episodes with suspected NVE,  F-FDG PET/CT showed a poor pooled sensitivity (36.3%) but an excellent pooled specificity (99.1%) for the diagnosis of NVE. Moreover, whole body  F-FDG PET/CT was able to assess the extent of the infection, being the first modality to diagnose extra-cardiac foci in up to 79% of cases [ ].  F-FDG PET/CT was also able to provide alternative infectious foci by rejected NVE diagnosis as well as noninfectious relevant diagnosis, such as neoplastic or inflammatory disease [ , , , , , ]. \n\nIn four studies,  F-FDG PET/CT findings were included in the final decision of the MET [ , , , ]. This could have led to an underestimation of the false positive cases, and thus contribute to the excellent specificity. However, three others studies [ , , ] excluded the  F-FDG PET/CT results from the final decision, always with an excellent specificity by 100%. Moreover, two of these studies had an external validation using histopathological findings, whenever available. These observations confirm the excellent specificity of  F-FDG PET/CT for this indication. This specificity is clearly superior in this indication in comparison to PVE [ , ]. The reason for this superiority is the absence of prosthetic material that can cause reactive post-operative  F-FDG uptake. \n\nHeterogeneity in patient preparation has contributed to the poor sensitivity of  F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of NVE. Due to the physiological myocardial glucose uptake, a metabolic shift of the myocardium exclusively towards fatty acid metabolism is required before administration of  F-FDG, an analog of glucose. This can be achieved using different techniques, including dietary manipulation, as well as administration of some drugs such as heparin, known to increase the lipolysis [ ]. The only study not including a HFLC diet in the patient preparation reported a relatively low rate of complete myocardial glucose uptake suppression (61% of patients with suspected PVE and NVE) and the poorest sensitivity (0%) of the included articles [ ]. Some studies decided to exclude patients with inadequate  F-FDG myocardial suppression [ , ], introducing a selection bias in their results. This inadequate patient preparation is likely the reason for the false positive cases reported in two studies, since no physiological valvular or paravalvular  F-FDG uptake is expected, except from the surrounding myocardium [ , ]. Abikhzer et al. [ ] reported incomplete  F-FDG myocardial suppression in 60% of the false negative studies. Interestingly, after excluding these patients, the  F-FDG PET/CT sensitivity significantly increased from 67.7% to 80%, without altering the excellent specificity. This sensitivity remains lower than the reported high sensitivity of TEE for NVE, in the range of 95%\u2013100% [ ]. However, based on its higher specificity,  F-FDG PET/CT could be considered in patients with possible NVE after doubtful or negative TTE or with a contra-indication for TEE [ , ]. Since the scans results have major implications on patient management, it is of the utmost importance to implement standardized preparation protocols with higher rate of adequate  F-FDG myocardial suppression [ ]. \n\nInflammatory cells, especially monocytes, are constituents of the inflammatory response following adhesion and invasion of the valvular site by pathogens, with a marked increase of their glycolytic activity, allowing their visualization by  F-FDG PET/CT [ ]. In 54 patients with NVE, De Carmargo et al. [ ] compared the  F-FDG uptake pattern with histopathological analysis, including the presence of fibrin, inflammatory infiltrate, and fibrosis. They demonstrated a significantly lower accumulation of fibrin, inflammatory cells, especially polymorphonuclear cells, and a significant higher content of fibrosis in NVE samples in comparison to PVE samples. These authors associated the reduced accumulation of inflammatory cells in NVE with the fact that vegetations are avascular and mostly of small size (less than 10 mm). The direct consequence is the reduced  F-FDG uptake by NVE, insufficient to be clearly differentiated from the background activity, and thus to be visualized by  F-FDG PET/CT. Moreover, the constant movement of the valve makes the situation worse since the already low  F-FDG signal is being blurred by this valve\u2019s motion [ ]. In one study, the use of innovative acquisition sequence, such as delayed acquisitions (134 \u00b1 42 min post injection of  F-FDG, compared to the standard acquisition performed 45-60 min post injection of  F-FDG) was shown to contribute to a significant increase the  F-FDG PET/CT performance to diagnose NVE [ ]. Indeed, the authors demonstrated an increase of the target to background ratio (TBR) on delayed images in comparison to standard images, allowing the identification of a large number of positive findings. Moreover, in this study, acquisitions of simultaneous electrocardiogram- and respiratory-gated cardiac images with motion correction provided a better contrast resolution (more counts per pixel), a better spatial resolution (larger matrix and smaller pixel size), as well as less scattering, leading to an improved sensitivity to detect lower metabolic activity, as well as better metabolic and anatomic image fusion [ ]. This evidence points out the technical differences of the PET/CT systems, and explains the superiority in the detection rate of NVE in the one recent study using a contemporary PET/CT device [ ]. \n\nSince the diagnosis of NVE is challenging, this meta-analysis emphasizes the need for a MET to include as much clinical and imaging information as possible in the final diagnosis. Four studies reported the performance of mDC in the detection of NVE as compared to  F-FDG PET/CT. In two of them,  F-FDG PET/CT was superior to mDC: in one of these studies [ ], mostly TTE rather than TEE was performed in patients with possible or rejected diagnosis of NVE, whereas in the other one [ ], use of delayed PET/CT acquisitions as well as a contemporary PET/CT device allowed for the diagnosis of most of the positive cases. In the two other studies, mDC was superior to  F-FDG PET/CT [ , ]. Thus, compared individually to mDC,  F-FDG PET/CT showed variable performance. Two studies [ , ] proposed new criteria of the mDC based on the  F-FDG PET/CT findings and assessed their additive value on the overall performance of mDC. The major criterion was defined as a focal valvular or paravalvular  F-FDG uptake. The minor criterion was defined as the presence of septic emboli. Indeed,  F-FDG PET/CT as whole-body imaging method can detect septic emboli (except for the brain due to the increased cerebral glycolytic activity [ ]), allowing the diagnosis of peripheral infectious complications. When integrating these new criteria in the mDC, its sensitivity increased up to 78%, without significantly affecting its specificity, which was up to 91% [ , ]. This led to a reclassification for up to 44% of patients from possible to definite NVE [ , ]. In the absence of an external gold standard, this performance could have been bias. Indeed, in this specific subgroup of patients with persistent suspicion of NVE and normal or doubtful echocardiography, no histological correlation between  F-FDG uptake and the presence of infection can be made, since these patients usually had no indication for valve surgery. De Carmago et al. [ ] made a histological correlation between  F-FDG uptake and the histological confirmation of NVE in patients with confirmed NVE which undergone valve surgery. Thus, this evidence could be translated in this specific subgroup of patients, since no physiological  F-FDG uptake is expected in the valvular area. However, the present data did not report on the number of patients with NVE with negative echocardiography, but positive valvular  F-FDG uptake. This information would have allowed a better assessment of the valvular  F-FDG uptake performance, since the value of septic emboli is still established in this specific group of patients [ ]. Nevertheless, based on these promising results, in patients with doubtful echocardiography findings, the use of  F-FDG PET/CT may be helpful in the final diagnosis of NVE [ , ]. Furthermore,  F-FDG PET/CT in some cases revealed the presence of malignant lesions, alternative infectious foci, or other inflammatory diseases, such as cardiac sarcoidosis, with the possibility of an early curative management [ , , , , , ]. Gomes et al. [ ] pointed out the additive value of the use of flowchart integrating multimodality imaging to increase the detection performance of NVE. Integrating the findings of  F-FDG PET/CT with cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) and echocardiography (TTE and TEE) following a specific flowchart was feasible in clinical practice, providing complementary information on the anatomical cardiac structures and the extension of the infection. This led to significant increase in sensitivity for the diagnosis of NVE up to 86%, as compared to the sensitivity of each individual imaging modality. Finally, the specific patient referral through an MET increased the prevalence of the IE in the population referred for imaging investigation, leading to increased performance of the imaging tool. All this evidence could be discussed by the update of the next guidelines on the diagnosis of IE. \n\nThe suspicion of NVE requires the administration of large spectral antibiotics [ ]. Since cardiac  F-FDG PET/CT requires a dietary preparation, it is mostly performed a few days after introduction of an antibiotic treatment. Three studies reported on the impact of antibiotic treatment duration in the performance of  F-FDG PET/CT [ , , ]. In one study, the vast majority of patients with false negative results (9/10) were under antibiotic treatment [ ]. Even if no information about the length of the treatment prior to PET/CT was provided, it can be suggested that antibiotics treatment could have led to false negative  F-FDG PET/CT. This would be in line with observations in PVE. Indeed, a prolonged antibiotic therapy could bring the pathogens in a quiescent status, leading to less accumulation of the inflammatory cells at the site of infection and therefore less or absent  F-FDG accumulation [ , ]. However, two other studies showed no significant difference on the performance of  F-FDG PET/CT depending on the duration of the antibiotic treatment [ , ]. Of note, in these two studies, the sensitivity was much lower compared to the first study [ ]. This controversy has to be further investigated in future studies. \n\nThe most common microbiological pathogens found as causes of NVE were Staphylococcus aureus (SA), followed by Streptococcus species (SS). The included studies did not perform cost-effectiveness analysis about the role of  F-FDG PET/CT in NVE. Interestingly, a previous study performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of  F-FDG PET/CT in SA and SS bacteremia. This study demonstrated a decrease in morbidity and mortality when  F-FDG PET/CT was included in the diagnostic algorithm to search for metastatic foci in patients with suspected endocarditis, with mean incremental costs within the range considered to be efficient by Dutch guidelines [ ]. In this study, specific criteria to stratify the patient embolic risk were defined, such as persistent fever more than 72 h after administration of appropriate treatment, persistent positive blood culture over 48 h after administration of appropriate treatment, signs of infection 48 h prior administration of appropriate treatment, and community acquisition. The authors concluded that in patients with one or more of these risk features, there was a clinical, cost-effective benefit when  F-FDG PET/CT was performed for the search of embolic foci. \n\nFinally, no studies evaluating the accuracy of SUVmax could demonstrate any utility compared to the visual assessment. Therefore, this semi-quantitative score value is not recommended for the diagnosis of NVE in the clinical routine. This can be explained by the fact that many external factors (i.e., time interval between injection of  F-FDG and image acquisition, plasma glucose, PET/CT scanner performances, etc.) can influence the SUVmax, resulting in wide variation among patients [ ]. Thus, establishing a threshold to detect infection can be challenging. \n\nIn this meta-analysis, we focused on the diagnostic performance of  F-FDG PET/CT for the detection of NVE. However, the diagnostic performance of an imaging test is not the only component of a successful clinical management. Other factors influence the clinical management of patients with suspected NVE, such as availability, local expertise in images interpretation, radiation dose, safety, examination time, organization, and cost-effectiveness. \n\nIn this meta-analysis,  F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated poor pooled sensitivity and excellent specificity. However, many limiting factors were identified, which can be considered in future larger prospective and multicenter studies. Specifically, the use of standardized preparation protocol for  F-FDG myocardial suppression with higher success rates should be implemented in further studies. Moreover, the value of semi-quantitative analysis of PET/CT images should be further assessed. Additional studies are also needed to evaluate the simultaneous acquisition of  F-FDG PET/CT with cardiac CTA as well as the diagnostic accuracy of new PET/CT generation with higher timing and spatial resolution. \n\nSome limitations and biases of our meta-analysis should be mentioned. First of all, a limited number of studies were available. Due to this limited number of studies, no significant biases among the included studies were identified. Heterogeneity among the studies (i.e., due to different characteristics among the included patients, difference in methodological aspects, and difference in gold standard) could also represent a potential source of bias in our meta-analysis [ ]. On the other hand, we did not find a significant statistical heterogeneity among the studies included in our pooled analysis. The absence of a true independent gold standard could have introduced a certain bias in the evaluation of the  F-FDG PET/CT performance to detect NVE. More, in the specific subgroup of patients with possible NVE, but normal or doubtful echocardiography, the added value of valvular  F-FDG uptake needs to be better assessed. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn this meta-analysis specifically designed to assess the performance of  F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of NVE, we demonstrated the poor pooled sensitivity and excellent pooled specificity of  F-FDG PET/CT in this setting. However, when using contemporary PET/CT device with innovative image acquisitions, the sensitivity increased, with still excellent specificity. Moreover, including  F-FDG PET/CT findings in the mDC further increased the mDC sensitivity for the detection of NVE without affecting its specificity. Finally, when adding the results of  F-FDG PET/CT in a multimodality strategy, the overall sensitivity for the detection of NVE can be improved. However, these findings need to be confirmed in larger prospective multicenter studies. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7601576, "text_md5": "771254c24f46509d99bf9fc196881546", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 309], "journal": [310, 329], "publication_year": [331, 335], "title": [346, 462], "keywords": [476, 645], "abstract": [658, 2192], "body": [2201, 34271]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 32993032, "doi": "10.3390/diagnostics10100754", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7601576", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7601576"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7601576\">7601576</a>", "list_title": "PMC7601576  Diagnostic Performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT in Native Valve Endocarditis: Systematic Review and Bivariate Meta-Analysis"}

A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of ASL, DSC-MRI, and DKI in the grading of cerebral gliomas. \n\n\n## Result \n  \nA total of 54 articles (11 in Chinese and 43 in English) were included. Three quantitative parameters in the grading of cerebral gliomas, rCBF in ASL, rCBV in DSC-MRI, and MK in DKI had the pooled sensitivity of 0.88 [95% CI (0.83,0.92)], 0.92 [95% CI (0.83,0.96)], 0.88 [95% CI (0.82,0.92)], and the pooled specificity of 0.91 [95% CI (0.84,0.94)], 0.81 [95% CI (0.73,0.88)], 0.86 [95% CI (0.78,0.91)] respectively. The pooled area under the curve (AUC) were 0.95 [95% CI (0.93,0.97)], 0.91 [95% CI (0.89,0.94)], 0.93 [95% CI (0.91,0.95)] respectively. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nQuantitative parameters rCBF, rCBV and MK have high diagnostic accuracy for preoperative grading of cerebral gliomas. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \nGliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system, accounting for about 45% of all intracranial tumors [ ]. On pathology, Gliomas can be divided into low-grade gliomas (LGGs, including WHO I\u2009~\u2009II) and high-grade gliomas (HGGs, including WHO III\u2009~\u2009IV) according to their histological and molecular features [ ]. Surgical resection combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy are still the basic treatment for gliomas. LGGs grow slowly and has a favorable prognosis in general [ ]; but HGGs are more aggressive with a 5-year relative survival rate of 15\u201358% for anaplastic astrocytomas and of 6\u201322% for glioblastomas depending upon their age at diagnosis and various other prognostic factors [ ]. Therefore, accurate assessment of the pathological grade of gliomas before surgery is of great clinical significance to determine the surgical resection range and to improve the survival rate of patients. \n\nIn the course of gliomas progression, the microstructures of tumors (tumor cell density, cell proliferation activity, and microvessel density, etc.) will undergo tremendous changes, reflecting the changes in histopathological characteristics of tumors [ ]. Traditional morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can estimate the extent of histopathological differentiation of tumors based on cytotoxic edema, hemorrhage, necrosis, heterogeneity of signal intensity, degree and range of signal enhancement. However, studies have shown that the enhancement of gliomas is not completely consistent with tumor grade [ ]. Roy et al. [ ] reported that the sensitivity of conventional MRI to differentiate high-grade gliomas from low-grade gliomas ranged from 55.1 to 83.3%. \n\nWith the continuous development of MRI technology, multi-modal MRI technology has been used to evaluate the biological characteristics of gliomas from different perspectives and has potential application value in the grading of gliomas. Among them, artery spin labeling (ASL) and dynamic magnetic sensitivity enhanced perfusion imaging (DSC-MRI) are perfusion-weighted imaging techniques, while diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging technique. Quantitative perfusion parameters such as relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in ASL, relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in DSC-MRI and mean kurtosis (MK) in DKI are receiving more attention in the clinical application of preoperative grading of gliomas. Compared with low-grade gliomas, high-grade gliomas have a more abundant blood supply, so hemodynamic perfusion parameters will increase significantly [ ]. The cellular pleomorphism and nuclear polymorphism in high-grade gliomas are more marked than those in low-grade gliomas, and the parameters associated with water molecular diffusion are also larger [ ]. \n\nMost previous researches only utilized perfusion imaging or diffusion imaging to investigate the grading of gliomas, focusing on meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy. The meta-analysis of quantitative parameters of the above imaging methods are lacking. Moreover, previous efforts only focused on the meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy and lacked the meta-analysis on quantitative parameters. Due to the small sample size and incomplete parameters of individual studies, the reliability and repeatability of the technology are still unclear. Therefore, we propose a large sample-size comprehensive meta-analysis to resolve the conflicting findings in different studies and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the quantitative perfusion and diffusion parameters in gliomas grading. \n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Literature retrieval \n  \nA thorough search for literature from 2005 to 2019 relating to ASL, DSC-MRI or DKI in the grading of cerebral gliomas was performed, using sources from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CBM, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database. English search keywords were (astrocytoma or glioblastoma or glioma tumor or astrocytic tumor or gliomas or oligodendroglioma or oligodendroglial tumor) and (DKI or Diffusional Kurtosis or Kurtosis Imaging or kurtosis or DSC-MRI or Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI or Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast or DSC or rCBV or rCBF or ASL or arterial spin-labeling or perfusion or Continuous ASL perfusion or PASL or 3DpCASL or three-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling). In order to avoid missing documents, the combination of electronic search and manual search were performed. \n\n\n### Literature inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \n#### Inclusion criteria \n  \n(1) ASL, DSC-MRI or DKI were used to differentiate gliomas of different grades; (2) At least one quantitative parameter of rCBF, rCBV and MK could be extracted or calculated from the study; (3) Only pathological diagnoses were included; (4) All subtypes of gliomas were included; (5) Fourfold table values of diagnostic tests can be obtained directly or indirectly, i.e. true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative; (6) The quality evaluation scores of the included studies were at least 9 since high-quality studies are the basis for reliable meta-analysis. \n\n\n#### Exclusion criteria \n  \n(1) animal experiments, such as animal experiments of rats; (2) any unpublished conference abstracts, comments, duplication of literature or research; (3) similar studies written by the same author; (4) lack of key data; (5) use of other imaging methods (such as CT, PET, etc.). \n\n\n\n### Data extraction from literature \n  \nThe basic information includes first author\u2019s name, country, the time of publication, patient age, tumor grade, number of cases, instrument type and field strength, journal of publication, methods, sequence and so on. Diagnostic information includes sensitivity, specificity, Fourfold table and the ROC curve with the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) value. If the information could not be obtained directly, the statistics were performed with the number of HGG and LGG cases and the sensitivity and specificity provided by the literature using RevMan 5.3 Software [ ]. For articles providing sample size, median, extremum or quartile, methods of Luo et al. [ ] and Wan et al. [ ] were applied to estimate the mean and standard deviation of samples [ ,  ]. \n\n\n### Quality evaluation \n  \nTwo researchers independently browsed the title and abstract of the retrieved literature, and read the full text of the literature that may meet the inclusion criteria, and finally determine whether to include them. If there were any disagreements especially on quality assessment, it was resolved by discussion with a third senior clinician. All selected studies were previously published, so there was no need for ethical review and approval or patients consent. \n\nThe quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) recommended by Cochrane Collaboration was adopted as the evaluation criterion [ ]. QUADAS-2 consists of the following key aspects: patient selection, index test, gold standard, flow and timing. Each of them was assessed in terms of risk of bias and signaling questions (yes/no/unclear) were included to assist in judgments. When the criterion is yes, the score increases by 1 point. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \n#### Heterogeneity test \n  \nHeterogeneity caused by different type of research design, age and gender of patients, pathological subtypes and other variables is a critical factor influencing the accuracy of results. The existence non-threshold effect was tested by Q-test and   I   value using RevMan 5.3 Software.   I  <50% indicates insignificant heterogeneity, and a fixed-effect model was applied to merge statistics.   I  \u00a0\u2265\u200950% indicates substantial heterogeneity, and a random-effect model was used to merge statistics. Q-test level was   P  \u2009<\u20090.05. \n\n\n#### Meta-analysis \n  \nRevMan 5.3 Software (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) was used to calculate the effect size and 95% CI. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic ratio, AUC and its 95% CI were calculated by Stata 13.1, and SROC curves were constructed. \n\n\n#### Publication bias \n  \nPublication bias was evaluated with Deek\u2019s funnel plot by Stata 13.1 software.   P  \u2009>\u20090.1 indicated that there was no publication bias. \n\n\n#### Sensitivity analysis \n  \nThe stability of included studies was evaluated. We eliminated an individual study and calculated the pooled effect of the rest of studies. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Literature retrieval results \n  \nFifty-four studies were selected for inclusion after reading the full text, of which 43 were in English and 11 were in Chinese. Patients include both adults and children. The studies were conducted in the following countries: China (  n  \u2009=\u200924), India (n\u2009=\u20092), Italy (  n  \u2009=\u20093), Spain (  n  \u2009=\u20091), Turkey (  n  \u2009=\u20091), Sweden (n\u2009=\u20092), Japan (n\u2009=\u20093), Norway (  n  \u2009=\u20091), the United States (  n  \u2009=\u20095), Canada (n\u2009=\u20091), Korea (n\u2009=\u20092), France (n\u2009=\u20091), Germany (  n  \u2009=\u20094). Denmark (n\u2009=\u20091), Belgium (n\u2009=\u20091), Brazil (n\u2009=\u20091), Australia (n\u2009=\u20091). Seven studies reported two methods. Of those studies including quantitative data and Continuous Variable Forest Map, 20 was in ASL, 22 in DSC-MRI, 15 in DKI. Of those studies including fourfold table data for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests, 19 was in ASL, 19 in DSC-MRI, 16 in DKI. The flowchart of retrieval process is presented in Fig.\u00a0 . The basic information of the literature included is presented in Table\u00a0 .\n   \nFlow chart of literature screening and identification process \n    \nBasic information of included studies \n  \n\n\n### Analysis \n  \n#### rCBF in ASL \n  \nTwenty studies assessing the difference of rCBF between HGGs and LGGs were included. Heterogeneity test showed that   \u03c7  \u2009=\u200966.79,   I  \u2009=\u200972%,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, indicating substantial heterogeneity. Therefore, the random effect model was applied to estimate the pooled rCBF. The pooled rCBF was 1.45 (1.12, 1.77),   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 (Fig.\u00a0 ).\n   \nForest plot of mean difference in rCBF between HGGs and LGGs in ASL. Positive results were observed between HGGs and LGGs \n  \n\n\n#### rCBV in DSC-MRI \n  \nTwenty-two studies assessing the difference of rCBV between HGGs and LGGs were included. Heterogeneity test showed that   \u03c7  \u2009=\u200974.23,   I  \u2009=\u200972%,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, indicating substantial heterogeneity. Therefore, the random effect model was applied to estimate the pooled rCBV. The pooled rCBV was 1.37 (1.08, 1.66),   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 (Fig.\u00a0 ).\n   \nForest plot of mean difference in rCBV between HGGs and LGGs in DSC-MRI. Positive results were observed between HGGs and LGGs \n  \n\n\n#### MK in DKI \n  \nFifteen studies assessing the difference of MK between HGGs and LGGs were included. Heterogeneity test showed that   \u03c7  \u2009=\u200946.39,   I  \u2009=\u200970%,   P  \u2009<\u20090.001, indicating substantial heterogeneity. Therefore, the random effect model was applied to estimate the pooled MK. The pooled MK was 1.57 (1.21, 1.93),   P  \u2009<\u20090.001 (Fig.\u00a0 ).\n   \nForest plot of mean difference in MK between HGGs and LGGs in DKI. Positive results were observed between HGGs and LGGs \n  \n\n\n#### Diagnostic value \n  \nSensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic ratio and area under curve were summarized according to the studies including fourfold table (Table\u00a0 ). The results showed that rCBF had the highest diagnostic ratio (DOR) of 71 (31,163). The SROC curve suggested that rCBF had the highest AUC value of 0.95 (0.93,0.97), followed by MK 0.93 (0.91,0.95), and rCBV 0.91 (0.89,0.94) (Fig.\u00a0 ).\n   \nThe values of rCBF, rCBV and MK \n    \nSROC Curve for Each Parameter in the Grading of Cerebral Gliomas.

Compared with 45% pre-test probability, the post-test probability of rCBF, rCBV and MK increases to 88, 80 and 83%, respectively. The DOR value of rCBF is 71 (31,163), indicating a high pooled diagnostic accuracy.\n   \nFagan Map for Each Parameter in the Grading of Cerebral Gliomas. A.ASL, B.

Among the five covariates in ASL study, region, year of study, number of patients and QUADAS-2 score were all important factors contributing to heterogeneity except for field strength. Among the six covariates in DSC-MRI study, region, year of study, number of patients, field strength and QUADAS-2 score, none had significant impact on heterogeneity. Among the five covariates in DKI study, the year of study, age of patients, number of patients and QUADAS-2 score all had no significant impact on heterogeneity except for region.\n   \nMeta-regression \n  \n\n\n#### Subgroup analysis \n  \nSubgroup analysis was successively carried out according to the region and technique in ASL, the region and magnetic resonance field strength in DSC-MRI, and the region in DKI. The results of subgroup analysis are shown in Table\u00a0 .\n   \nSubgroup analysis \n  \n\n\n\n### Publication bias \n  \nDeek\u2019s test was used to evaluate publication bias for studies containing fourfold Tables.   P  \u00a0>\u20090.1 indicated that there was no publication bias. 19 studies of ASL, 19 studies of DSC-MRI, 16 studies of DKI were eligible for Deek\u2019s test. Deeks funnel plot (Fig.\u00a0 ) showed no significant publication bias for all groups (  P  \u00a0=\u20090.85,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.45,   P  \u00a0=\u20090.12, for ASL, DSC-MRI, DKI group, respectively).\n   \nFunnel plot of publication bias.   a   ASL group; (  b  ) DSC-MRI group; (  c  ) DKI group \n  \n\n\n### Sensitivity analysis \n  \nSensitivity analysis is a key method for assessing heterogeneity and publication bias. We eliminated an individual study and calculated the pooled effect of the rest of studies. Compared with the pooled effect of all the included studies, we could determine the influence of individual study on the pooled effect. Results of this meta-analysis revealed that the included studies had no significant changes on the pooled value of rCBF and rCBV. However, the MK of Delgado et al. [ ] showed significant influence on heterogeneity and publication bias before it was eliminated (  I  \u00a0=\u200970% to   I  \u00a0=\u200954% calculated by Revman5.3). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis revealed the pooled rCBF, rCBV and MK of HGGs were higher than those of LGGs, with the results statistically significant. The specificity of rCBF is the highest among all parameters, suggesting that the rate of misdiagnosis in rCBF is the lowest. The sensitivity of rCBV is the highest, suggesting that the rate of missed diagnosis in rCBV is the lowest. The results of meta-regression showed that there were many factors contributing to the heterogeneity of ASL studies, while the studies of DSC-MRI and DKI were relatively stable. Although three kinds of MRI techniques included in this study could be applied to grade gliomas, the DOR suggested that rCBF in ASL had the highest diagnostics accuracy. \n\nDSC-MRI perfusion imaging uses an exogenous contrast agent and relies on the acquisition of T2* images. DSC-MRI detects changes in MR signal as the contrast agent passes through the blood vessels, thus haemodynamic parameter (rCBV) can be indicative of microvascular properties such as vascular flow [ ]. Compared to LGGs, HGGs have more abundant blood supply; therefore, the hemodynamic parameters (rCBV) would manifest notable increases significantly, which is consistent with the findings of Winkler et al. [ ]. Awasthi et al. [ ] observed that the microvessel density (MVD) and the positive expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) had significant correlation with the pathological grade of gliomas and the rCBV value. Although the range of rCBV values reported in the literature amongst various types of gliomas, the most researchers observed higher rCBV in HGGs [ ]. In this meta-analysis, we found that the discriminative values of sensitivity and specificity were 92 and 81% by rCBV between HGGs and LGGs. \n\nASL is a completely non-invasive MRI technique which measures blood flow by using magnetically labeled water protons in arterial blood as an endogenous tracer. It is not affected by the integrity of blood-brain barrier, therefore accurately evaluates gliomas microcirculation information, reflecting the situation of tumor angiogenesis, and thus the gliomas grade can be more accurately assessed [ ,  ]. The relative rCBF has been widely used to discriminate between LGGs and HGGs. Although ASL suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio as well as sensitivity to motion, Cebeci and Luh et al. reported a strong correlation between ASL-derived CBF values and DSC-derived CBF values in brain tumours [ ,  ]. Several studies had revealed that rCBF of ASL was a rigorous parameter of grading gliomas, thereby allowing it an alternative method of DSC-MRI [ \u2013 ]. \n\nDiffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), first proposed by Professor Jensen of New York University in 2005, is a technique intending to explore the properties of non-gaussian diffusion of water molecules [ ,  ]. It has been proposed to more accurately characterise the complicated water diffusion in biological tissues. The most commonly used parameter of DKI is mean kurtosis (MK) which provides additional information about tumour heterogeneity. The cellular pleomorphism and nuclear polymorphism in HGGs are more significant than those in LGGs. The proliferation of interstitial vessels is also more abundant in HGGs and thus the MK value is higher [ ]. Some studies indicated that MK was higher in HGGs. Raab et al. [ ] found that the AUC of MK was 92.3% for differentiating HGGs from LGGs, which were in strong agreement with the findings in this meta-analysis. \n\nHeterogeneity is common in meta-analysis. After excluding the research of Falk Delgado et al., the heterogeneity of MK decreased from 70 to 54%. Since there is moderate heterogeneity in this meta-analysis, clinical decisions should be made cautiously based on these results. Heterogeneity may be caused by the following aspects: (1) imbalance in the distribution of HGGs and LGGs: for instance, grade I gliomas were not studied in some research which resulted bias in case selection; (2) different experimental conditions set by researchers, such as different instrument models, parameter settings, post-processing methods, etc. (3) regional heterogeneity resulted from inclusion of literature from different countries and regions; (4) The region of interest (ROI) and the reference region were heterogeneously placed in the different studies, which may have an impact on the results. \n\nThe main limitations of this study are: 1. This study only focused on diagnostic value of ASL, DSC-MRI and DKI in distinguishing LGGs from HGGs, their role in the follow-up and each specific pathological grade of gliomas were not discussed; 2. Only research in Chinese and English were included, the sample size was relatively small; 3. Most studies used the WHO classification system without molecule genomics. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nQuantitative parameters rCBF in ASL, rCBV in DSC-MRI and MK in DKI had excellent diagnostic performances for differentiating HGGs from LGGs. rCBF is a rigorous parameter of grading gliomas with AUC of 0.95, thereby allowing it an alternative method of DSC-MRI or DKI. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7444047, "text_md5": "08106209d1cae693c63cbf7d145d26f3", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 101], "journal": [102, 114], "publication_year": [116, 120], "title": [131, 252], "keywords": [266, 300], "abstract": [313, 1753], "body": [1762, 21121]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 32831106, "doi": "10.1186/s13014-020-01643-y", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444047", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7444047"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444047\">7444047</a>", "list_title": "PMC7444047  The diagnostic value of quantitative analysis of ASL, DSC-MRI and DKI in the grading of cerebral gliomas: a meta-analysis"}

The optimal surgical approach for CM patients with ISI on T2-weighted MRI remains unclear. This meta-analysis aims to compare the clinical outcomes between anterior and posterior approaches for the treatment of these patients. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nMEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched for relevant studies through January 2019. Statistical comparisons were made when appropriate. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 9 studies (748 participants) out of 1066 citations were included in this study. All of the selected studies were high quality, as indicated by the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa scale and the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias. Clinical outcomes were compared between anterior and posterior approaches in 4 studies (237 participants). The preoperative Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score was similar between the two groups [  P  \u2009=\u20090.98, weighted mean difference (WMD)\u2009=\u20090.01 (\u2212\u20090.58, 0.59)]. The postoperative JOA score [  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, WMD\u2009=\u20090.68 (0.06, 1.30)] and recovery rates [  P  \u2009<\u20090.01, WMD\u2009=\u20090.12 (0.06, 0.17)] were significantly higher in the anterior group than in the posterior group. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe anterior approach was associated with better postoperative neural function than the posterior approach in CM patients with ISI on T2-weighted MRI. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCervical myelopathy (CM) is a common cause of progressive spinal cord dysfunction. The most common etiology for CM is spinal stenosis caused by cervical spondylosis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) [ ]. Surgical treatment aims to expand the cervical canal and relieve the compression of the spinal cord. There are two main surgical approaches: the anterior approach and the posterior approach. Anterior approaches, which can achieve direct decompression by directly removing the ventral stenosing focus, typically comprise anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and anterior cervical corpectomy decompression and fusion (ACCF). Posterior approaches, which can achieve indirect decompression by shifting the spinal cord posteriorly, typically comprise laminoplasty or laminectomy. The choice of the surgical approach for CM has been a controversial issue. Several recent meta-analyses concluded that the anterior approach is associated with better postoperative neurological outcomes than the posterior approach [ \u2013 ]. \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine is widely used in the diagnosis and preoperative evaluation of CM [ ]. Although increased signal intensity (ISI) on T2-weighted MRI often indicates more severe compression, its prognostic value has been debated in several articles with conflicting results, and the optimal surgical approach for these patients remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of surgical approaches for the treatment of patients with CM with ISI on T2-weighted MRI and to specifically evaluate the clinical results to guide clinical decision-making. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nStudies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) the study was a randomized or nonrandomized controlled study (for prospective studies) or a retrospective study, (2) patients were diagnosed with CM due to cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) or OPLL, (3) patients underwent surgical treatment, (4) comparative data between anterior and posterior approaches (regardless of the specific surgical approach) were available, (5) T2 ISI information was available for all or subgroups of patients, and (6) the study had an average follow-up time of \u2265\u200912\u2009months. Studies were excluded if (1) patients were diagnosed with CM resulting from another etiology, such as trauma, a tumor, or rheumatoid arthritis; (2) patients underwent related thoracic or lumbar surgeries; or (3) the full text could not be accessed. \n\n\n### Search strategy \n  \nMEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched through January 2019. The search was not restricted to any specific language or by the year of publication. The following search terms and strategies were used: (1) CM OR CSM OR myelopathy OR cervical spondylosis OR cervical vertebrae OR cervical stenosis OR OPLL OR ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament, (2) corpectomy OR ACDF OR ACCF OR anterior cervical corpectomy decompression and fusion OR anterior cervical discectomy and fusion OR anterior decompression OR ventral decompression OR ventral approach, (3) laminoplasty OR laminectomy OR posterior decompression OR posterior decompression and fusion OR dorsal decompression OR dorsal approach, (4) MRI OR T2 OR T2WI OR signal intensity OR magnetic resonance imaging, and (1) and (2) and (3) and (4). Data were extracted with a standardized form [ ]. The Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for quality assessment of nonrandomized studies [ ], and the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias [ ] was used for randomized studies. Two reviewers independently reviewed the articles in the initial and full-text reviews. Any disagreement between reviewers was resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nInconsistency between studies was quantified by calculating the   I   statistic. Continuous variables are reported as weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), whereas dichotomous variables are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. A random-effects model was used for heterogeneous data (  I  \u2009>\u200950%), whereas a fixed-effects model was used for homogenous data (  I  \u2009<\u200950%). For studies presenting data as medians and quartiles, the mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated by methods described by Hozo et al. [ ].   P  \u2009<\u20090.05 was considered to be statistically significant. SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), and Review Manager, version 5.1 (The Cochrane Collaboration), were used to perform statistical analysis. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Search results \n  \nThe initial database search identified 793 articles in MEDLINE, 619 in EMBASE, 840 in Web of Science, and 9 in CNKI. After excluding duplicate records, there were 1066 studies. A total of 1015 articles were excluded because they failed to meet the inclusion criteria after review of the abstracts and titles. An additional 42 articles were excluded after the full-text review. Hence, a total of 9 studies were finally selected, including 1 prospective randomized study, 6 prospective nonrandomized studies, and 2 retrospective studies. The detailed selection process is shown in Fig.\u00a0 .   \nA flow diagram of study selection \n  \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nThe basic characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table\u00a0 . The quality of the included nonrandomized studies was assessed using the NOS ( ). Two independent reviewers conducted the assessment. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Of the nonrandomized studies, four scored 8 points, two scored 7 points, and two scored 6 points (Table\u00a0 ). The Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias was used to assess the randomized study (one study), as shown in Figure S1. The assessments indicated that all of the studies were of relatively high quality.   \nBasic characteristics of the included studies \n  \n NM  , not mentioned \n    \nQuality assessment according to the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa scale \n  \n\n\n### Surgical approaches \n  \nThe 9 studies included a total of 748 patients with ISI on T2-weighted MRI. Data on the surgical approach were extracted for 505 patients, among whom 223 underwent an anterior approach, including ACCF, ACDF, anterior cervical disc replacement (ACDR), or hybrid anterior decompression and fusion (HDF), and 282 underwent a posterior approach, including laminoplasty or laminectomy. \n\n\n### Clinical outcomes \n  \nThe Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score was available in 4 studies to assess the clinical outcome (  n  \u2009=\u2009237 patients; 78 in the anterior group and 159 in the posterior group). The preoperative JOA score was similar between the two groups [  P  \u2009=\u20090.98, WMD\u2009=\u20090.01 (\u2212\u20090.58, 0.59); heterogeneity:   \u03c7  \u2009=\u20091.33, df\u2009=\u20093,   P  \u2009=\u20090.72;   I  \u2009=\u20090%, fixed-effects model; Fig.\u00a0 ]. The postoperative JOA score was significantly higher in the anterior group than in the posterior group [  P  \u2009<\u20090.05, WMD\u2009=\u20090.68 (0.06, 1.30); heterogeneity:   \u03c7  \u2009=\u20092.76, df\u2009=\u20093,   P  \u2009=\u20090.43;   I  \u2009=\u20090%, fixed-effects model; Fig.\u00a0 ]. The recovery rate, as defined by Hirabayashi\u2019s formula: (postoperative JOA score\u2009\u2212\u2009preoperative JOA score)/(17\u2009\u2212\u2009preoperative JOA score)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100%, was used to assess the surgical outcome. Similar to the results of the postoperative JOA score, the recovery rate was significantly higher in the anterior group than in the posterior group [  P  \u2009<\u20090.01, WMD\u2009=\u20090.12 (0.06, 0.17); heterogeneity:   \u03c7  \u2009=\u20093.59, df\u2009=\u20093,   P  \u2009=\u20090.31;   I  \u2009=\u200917%, fixed-effects model; Fig.\u00a0 ]. Data regarding complications were scarce. Only Sun\u2019s study reported that the anterior approach was associated with more blood loss and a longer operative time [ ].   \nWeighted mean difference in the preoperative JOA score between the anterior surgery group and the posterior surgery group \n    \nWeighted mean difference in the postoperative JOA score between the anterior surgery group and the posterior surgery group \n    \nWeighted mean difference in the recovery rate between the anterior surgery group and the posterior surgery group \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn the present study, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CNKI. We compared surgical outcomes of anterior and posterior surgical approaches in CM patients with ISI on T2-weighted MRI. We showed that the anterior approach was associated with better recovery than the posterior approach, as assessed by the JOA score. \n\nCM is a common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in older persons. Since Takahashi first reported ISI on T2-weighted MRI in a patient with CM [ ], MRI has been recognized as essential for the diagnosis and treatment of CM. It is documented that 41\u201397% of patients with CM have ISI on T2-weighted MRI within the cervical cord [ ]. The role of signal intensity changes on MRI has been widely investigated. There are several theories explaining ISI on T2-weighted MRI: (1) myelomalacia caused by spinal edema or chronic spinal cord compression, (2) destruction of the local cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier, (3) obstruction of the flow of CSF, and (4) degeneration of gray matter at the level of compression level [ ,  ]. Several studies have suggested that cervical instability is a risk factor for ISI on T2-weighted MRI because dynamic factors may result in spinal cord injury [ \u2013 ]. Moreover, Yagi et al. suggested that males were more likely to have ISI on T2-weighted MRI than females (OR\u2009=\u20093.348), although the difference was not significant (  P  \u2009=\u20090.101) [ ]. This finding may result from the higher morbidity of developmental cervical spinal canal stenosis in males than in females. \n\nSeveral studies have suggested that patients with ISI have poor clinical results after either conservative or surgical treatment. However, some other studies have challenged this hypothesis [ ]. To clarify this question, several studies have classified signal intensity changes via different methods and studied their relevance to clinical outcomes. Aditya et al. categorized the various classification methods into two major types: the longitudinal extent of ISI and qualitative classification of ISI [ ]. Studies using the longitudinal extent to classify ISI have usually suggested that patients with multisegmental ISI have more severely compressed cords [ ], poorer surgical outcomes [ ], and worse recovery rates [ ] than those with focal or absent ISI. The qualitative classification of ISI involves an assessment of the intensity, marginal pattern, or both. Studies using qualitative classification are controversial. Most studies have indicated that sharp, more intense ISI is correlated with worse clinical outcomes [ \u2013 ], whereas other studies have suggested that the intensity of ISI on T2-weighted images does not predict surgical outcomes [ ,  ]. \n\nAs there are usually multiple sources of compression from the anterior and/or posterior sides, several factors should be taken into consideration when choosing the approach. MRI findings play an important role in decision-making. Nouri et al. conducted a questionnaire survey among 513 AOSpine International members to understand how specific pathologic features on MRI influence the surgeon\u2019s selection of a surgical approach selection in patients with degenerative CM [ ]. Multilevel bulging disks, cervical kyphosis, and a high degree of anterior cord compression have been reported to lead to selection of an anterior approach, whereas a high degree of posterior cord compression, multilevel compression, OPLL, ligamentum flavum enlargement, and congenital stenosis have been reported to lead to selection of a posterior approach [ ,  ,  ]. Although the presence of ISI on T2-weighted MRI is not considered an important factor that influences decision-making, interviewers were slightly more likely to choose the anterior approach than the posterior approach (23.4% vs. 15.6%, respectively). \n\nIn the present study, the postoperative JOA scores and recovery rates were significantly higher following the anterior approach than following the posterior approach, suggesting that the neurological outcomes were better with the anterior approach. Although there have been no meta-analyses or systemic review studies focusing on the surgical approach for CM patients with ISI on T2-weighted MRI, there are similar studies regarding the surgical approach for all CM patients [ ,  \u2013 ]. In the study by Chen et al., a total of 25 nonrandomized controlled studies involving 1843 patients were included [ ]. Similarly, the anterior approach was found to be associated with better postoperative neurological outcomes than the posterior approach in CSM patients. However, several studies, including one meta-analysis [ ], have suggested that current studies are unable to demonstrate clinically significant differences between anterior and posterior approaches. Our study showed a 12% higher recovery rate following the anterior approach than following the posterior approach. Since ISI often indicates severe compression, the anterior approach is effective in releasing the compressed spinal cord in patients with ISI. Compared with the posterior approach, the anterior approach can decompress the spinal cord directly and allow substantial restoration of cervical lordosis. This may also explain why studies on surgical approach selection for all CM patients are controversial\u2014in terms of the patients with mild CM, both the anterior and posterior approach can provide sufficient space for a compressed spinal cord. \n\nSurgical complications of CM include dysphagia, airway compromise, dysphonia, C5 nerve palsy, blood loss, and postoperative wound infection. For all CM patients (regardless of T2-weighted imaging findings), no significant differences in complication rates and revision rates have been observed in previous studies when comparing the anterior approach with the posterior approach [ \u2013 ]. Data for patients with ISI on T2-weighted MRI are scarce, and the available studies did not report the incidence rate in detail. Sun et al. suggested that OPLL patients with ISI on T2-weighted MRI had more blood loss and a longer operative time than those without ISI [ ]. This outcome may be because anterior exposure of the cervical spine involves more complex and potentially dangerous anatomy, especially for patients with ISI on T2-weighted MRI. However, more data are needed to draw a conclusion. \n\nOur study has several limitations. First, the disparity in surgical interventions was not considered\u2014i.e., ACCF vs. ACDF, laminectomy vs. laminoplasty\u2014although postoperative outcomes have been suggested to be similar in previous studies [ ,  ]. Second, most of our included studies were nonrandomized. Although the quality of the included studies did not seem to be poor based on an assessment with the NOS or the Cochrane Collaboration tool, more randomized controlled trials are needed due to the variety of procedures available and the spectrum of results. Third, as the CNKI contains only Chinese literature, the use of this database might have resulted in selection bias. Moreover, most studies commented sparsely about specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, the anterior approach was associated with better postoperative neural function than the posterior approach in CM patients with ISI on T2-weighted MRI. The complication rate requires further investigation. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6639962, "text_md5": "1bec8c7d11d5c3baf771235682a6035e", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 75], "journal": [76, 93], "publication_year": [95, 99], "title": [110, 234], "keywords": [248, 248], "abstract": [261, 1798], "body": [1807, 17323]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31319870, "doi": "10.1186/s13018-019-1265-z", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6639962", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6639962"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6639962\">6639962</a>", "list_title": "PMC6639962  Surgical approaches and outcomes for cervical myelopathy with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI: a meta-analysis"}

Pubmed, Embase, and CINAHL were searched systematically. A diagnostic study was included if it performed MRI (index test) and postnatal examination (reference test) in fetuses at risk for orofacial clefts. Methodological quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2. A meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model, calculating the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve. The search resulted in eight studies (334 fetuses) to be included: four prospective and four retrospective studies. The applicability concern was low. There was, however, a risk of selection and information bias. All studies showed that MRI well predicted the chance of cleft palate. The sensitivity results were homogeneous, but heterogeneity was assumed regarding the specificity estimate (Cochrane\u2019s   Q   test:   p   = 0.00). The pooled sensitivity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.93\u20130.99); the pooled specificity was 0.94 (0.89\u20130.97). The area under the curve was 0.98 (95% CI 0.98\u20130.99). \n\n Conclusion  : This meta-analysis shows that MRI has an excellent sensitivity and good to excellent specificity for diagnosing cleft palate in fetuses at risk for orofacial clefts. Future research should assess applicability for clinical care.   \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00431-019-03500-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nOrofacial clefts are one of the most common facial malformations [ ]. The prevalence of orofacial clefts differs from 10.2 per 10,000 in the United States and Western Europe to 20.0 per 10,000 in Japan [ ]. This condition can be either a cleft lip (CL), a cleft palate (CP), or both CL and CP (CLP) [ ]. Orofacial clefts often result in feeding problems and difficulties in speech [ ]. Also, many children with CLP or CP have chromosomal abnormalities, with the highest prevalence in children with isolated CP [ ]. Approximately 50% of the isolated CP\u2019s are associated with other malformations, such as congenital heart defects or urinary tract defects [ ]. \n\nOrofacial clefts are diagnosed by physical examination and visual inspection of the infant directly after birth [ ]. To evaluate the palate, the mouth is inspected with a flashlight, while a spatula is used to depress the tongue. \n\nOrofacial clefts are increasingly diagnosed prenatally during the ultrasound (US) fetal anomaly scan, often performed around the 20th week of the pregnancy [ ]. After detecting abnormalities during this US screening, it is advised to refer the pregnant women with the fetus to a tertiary center, where the diagnosis is further explored [ ]. Fetuses with a family risk factor for CL, CP, or CLP can be referred directly to these centers, since orofacial clefts are strongly genetically related [ ]. \n\nPrenatal diagnosis provides opportunities for prenatal counselling and planning postnatal management [ ,  ]. Prenatal counselling aims to help parents to cope with having a baby with a cleft and allows parents to make extra preparatory arrangements for the baby. Prenatal counselling also includes giving parents expert advice and support in the choice of the feeding method (breast milk or formula) allowing parents to make the feeding decision prior to the birth [ ]. A study including 29 couples reported that 96% of the parents considered prenatal counselling as beneficial [ ]. Early detection of orofacial clefts can also enable organization of the delivery in a tertiary center [ ] and lead to fewer medical complications [ ]. \n\nUnfortunately, many clefts are not detected during the US screening, since the detection rate differs from 9 to 50% and is further limited by factors such as maternal obesity [ ,  ]. Specifically the palate can often not be adequately visualized, due to acoustic shadowing, which results in misdiagnoses of the palate [ ,  ]. A systematic review investigated the diagnostic accuracy of second-trimester US in low- and high-risk populations [ ]. A total of 27 articles were included, among which six studies with fetuses at high risk for orofacial clefts. Most studies reported detection rates between 9 and 50%, but results varied widely, depending on the population (high/low risk), type of cleft, and gestational age at the time of the scan. Detection rates were lower in the high-risk population: 0 to 44% of the orofacial clefts were detected prenatally using US in fetuses at risk. For isolated CP, the detection rate was 0% in this population. Assessing the palate during prenatal screening is essential in fetuses at risk for orofacial clefts, since CP has the highest association with feeding difficulties and other abnormalities [ ]. The presence of a cleft palate can sometimes be used to rule out other diagnoses, such as a tumor, an encephalocele, or a vascular of lymphatic malformation [ ]. Also, a recent systematic review investigated the prevalence of associated anomalies related to cleft category and concluded that prenatal counselling should be tailored to cleft category (CL, CP, or CLP) [ ]. Without accurate information about the condition of the palate, this recommendation cannot be fulfilled. \n\nStudies show magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has potential to improve the prenatal detection rate of CP and should be considered as a complement to the current diagnostic procedure in fetuses at risk for a CP [ ,  ]. Fetuses are at risk if the US screening shows abnormalities or if a family risk factor is present [ ]. To evaluate the diagnostic value of MRI, information about the sensitivity and specificity of performing prenatal MRI for detecting CP is needed. A high sensitivity of the test is important to provide the prenatal counselling, including information about specific risks of CP. On the other hand, a high specificity prevents needless diagnoses, subsequent stress, and further medical investigations that could be a risk for the fetus. Namely, invasive genetic tests are indicated for CLP and CP with or without associated anomalies, but not for CL [ ]. Therefore, the authors consider sensitivity and specificity of equal importance in the prenatal diagnosis of CP. \n\nTo decide if the prenatal diagnostic procedure for fetuses at risk for orofacial clefts should be extended by performing an MRI, information about its diagnostic value is needed. A few studies with relative small sample sizes were conducted to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of MRI for detecting CP [ ,  ,  ]. Currently, no systematic review or meta-analysis has been conducted. Therefore, the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in detecting CP remains unknown. The aim of this meta-analysis is to establish the sensitivity and specificity of MRI in the prenatal diagnosis of cleft palate in fetuses at risk for orofacial clefts. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Design \n  \nTo establish the diagnostic accuracy of MRI for the prenatal detection of CP, a meta-analysis was conducted according to the method of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and following the steps of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement [ ,  ]. \n\n\n### Information sources \n  \nThe databases PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL were searched, because the subject of this meta-analysis is biomedical and related to the nursing field. Moreover, these databases all contain diagnostic studies, suitable for the research question. In case of good but insufficient data presented in the studies, authors were mailed to gain more specific results that could be used in the meta-analysis. \n\n\n### Search method \n  \nTwo reviewers (HH and AH) independently searched in the electronic databases on the 15th of June 2019. The search query combined the keywords fetuses, magnetic resonance imaging, cleft palate, and derivatives of these terms. The search strategy is provided in detail  . The keywords sensitivity and specificity were not included in the search query, because consistent use of those terms in electronic databases is doubted and could consequently lead to missing relevant articles [ ]. The references of all included studies were examined. \n\n\n### Inclusion criteria \n  \nThe inclusion criteria included specifications of the patient-group and results of prior testing, since test accuracy can vary due to these factors [ ]. A paper was included if (1) it was a full-text article, (2) published in English or Dutch, (3) included fetal MRI as index test and postnatal diagnosis as reference standard performed by physical examination or autopsy, (4) described the outcome as type of orofacial cleft with at least a distinction in CL and CP, (5) was conducted in a population of fetuses at risk for orofacial clefts (due to a positive or unclear US screening or orofacial cleft in a first degree relative), and (6) sensitivity or specificity were mentioned or calculable from study results. \n\nExclusion criteria were formulated concerning the research design, number of participants, and purpose of the study. Studies with < 10 participants were excluded, because small sample sizes cause concern regarding the power and precision of studies [ ]. Case reports, editorials, opinions, dissertations, intervention studies, and reviews were excluded as well as studies using fetal MRI for another purpose than diagnosing orofacial clefts. There was no restriction on the date of publication. \n\nAll included articles were also included in the meta-analysis, since the inclusion criteria were narrow regarding the population, index and reference test and calculability of sensitivity and specificity. A subgroup of the study sample was included if part of the sample did not meet the inclusion criteria. \n\n\n### Study selection \n  \nAfter removing duplicates, the two reviewers (HH and AH) independently evaluated the eligibility of the selected studies from the literature in two phases. The first phase consisted of title and abstract screening and the second phase consisted of screening full-text articles. Disagreements were resolved in a consensus meeting. \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nData were extracted regarding study methodology, nation, patient population, inclusion and exclusion criteria, details about the performance of the index test, and details about the performance of the reference test. Outcome data on CP detected by MRI and the postnatal diagnosis were extracted in 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables, describing true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN) results. Data extraction was performed independently by the two reviewers (HH and AH). Discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved in a consensus meeting. \n\n\n### Data synthesis and statistical analysis \n  \nThe statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 and Meta-Disc software version 1.4 [ ,  ]. Sensitivity and specificity along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each study and presented in forest plots. \n\nTo determine the appropriateness of statistical pooling of accuracy estimates, homogeneity needed to be assessed [ ]. Homogeneity means that the variation in the estimates of the test accuracy from different studies can be explained by study sampling error alone [ ]. For this meta-analysis, the homogeneity of the sensitivity and specificity of the included studies was assessed in three ways [ ]. First, the accuracy estimates of the forest plots were inspected visually. Estimates that lie along a line corresponding to the pooled accuracy estimate indicate homogeneity. Large deviations from this line indicate possible heterogeneity. Second, the Cochrane\u2019s   Q   test for heterogeneity was performed to evaluate if the differences across the studies are greater than expected by chance alone, using a chi-square (  \u03c7  ) distribution and k-1 degrees of freedom. A   p   value < 0.05 suggests the presence of heterogeneity. Third, the inconsistency index I-squared was calculated to quantify the amount of heterogeneity. An I-square > 50% indicates heterogeneity. Heterogeneity can arise from differences in cut-off point for defining a positive or negative result: a threshold effect [ ]. Assessing a threshold effect is not applicable for this meta-analysis, because the thresholds used in interpreting MRI are unquantifiable since they depend on interpretation. Furthermore, a summary receiver operating characteristics curve (sROC) was presented to visualize the test sensitivity against the test specificity. Also, 95% CI was given. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated and interpreted as follows: 0.5\u20130.6 = fail, 0.6\u20130.7 = poor, 0.7\u20130.8 = fair, 0.8\u20130.9 = good, 0.9\u20131 = excellent [ ]. \n\nFinally, a weighted, pooled estimate of sensitivity and specificity was calculated using the random-effects method [ ]. The weighting of the estimate depends on the number of participants included in this meta-analysis and is adjusted for the extent of heterogeneity. \n\n\n### Methodological quality \n  \nThe methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2), as the subject of this meta-analysis is determining diagnostic accuracy [ ]. This instrument distinguishes between bias and applicability and consists of four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. For risk of bias questions, the answer yes indicates high risk of bias, no indicates low risk of bias and the answer is \u201cunclear\u201d if insufficient data is reported to permit a judgment. Concerns regarding the applicability of results were raised if the patient selection, use of the index test, or the use of the reference test did not fully agree with the inclusion criteria of this meta-analysis. \n\nOverall quality scores were not indicated, because different shortcomings may lead to different magnitudes of bias and it is difficult to fairly weigh each quality item [ ]. Quality assessment was performed independently by the two reviewers (HH and AH) and all disagreements were resolved by consensus through discussion.\u2003 \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nThe search strategy yielded a total of 246 unique records. Furthermore, two additional results were found with reference checking. After screening on title and abstract, 19 articles appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. After reading the full-text articles, 11 studies were eventually excluded, resulting in a total of eight definite inclusions with a combined total of 334 fetuses [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. The flow diagram displaying exact details is presented in Fig.  .   \nFlow scheme of included studies \n  \n\n\n### Study characteristics \n  \nStudy characteristics are shown in Table  . The studies are all conducted in different countries: five countries in Europe [ ,  ,  ,  ], one in North America [ ], and two in Asia [ ,  ]. All studies were published in 2010 or later. Four studies had a prospective design [ ,  ,  ,  ] and four studies had a retrospective design [ ,  ,  ,  ]. The size of the study populations varied from 12 to 94 fetuses. The mean gestation time was 27.59 weeks at the time of the MRI. All studies included participants based on a positive US screening. Three studies also included fetuses based on a family risk factor: first degree family member having CL, CP, or CLP [ ,  ,  ]. Two studies excluded fetuses with associated abnormalities, such as agenesis of corpus callosum (a brain abnormality) [ ,  ]. Seven studies used a 1.5-T MRI system as the index test of different brands. In one study, the type of MRI scanner was not specified [ ]. Also, all studies used the postnatal diagnosis as the reference test performed by physical examination or autopsy. Autopsy was used in case of fetal death or termination of pregnancy.   \nCharacteristics of included studies \n  \nNo, number; NA, not applicable; US, ultrasound; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging \n\n*19/61 Fetuses were lost to follow up or underwent termination of pregnancy without autopsy and not included in the meta-analysis \n\n**2/27 Fetuses in twin pregnancy were not at risk for CP and not included in the meta-analysis \n\n***6/94 Fetuses were lost to follow-up and not included in the meta-analysis \n  \n\n\n### Methodological quality \n  \nThe risk of bias and applicability concerns are summarized in Table  . The patient selection of four studies was judged as high risk of bias, since a case control design was not avoided and it was unclear whether a consecutive sample of patients was enrolled [ ,  ,  ,  ]. In three studies, it was unclear how the participants enrolled [ ,  ,  ]. One study clearly stated that all patients with CL, CLP, or CP were approached and included in the study after referral to two centers for further diagnostics [ ].   \nSummary of quality assessment using QUADAS-2 \n  \n+, low risk; -, high risk; ?, unclear risk \n  \n\nTwo studies described a blinded procedure for interpretation of the index test [ ,  ]. The other studies were unclear about this procedure [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. Although technical specifications of the MRI scanner were frequently provided, the radiologists criteria for diagnosing CP were unclear in all studies. \n\nRegarding the applicability of the studies, all studies had the main aim of determining the diagnostic accuracy of the MRI in detecting CP or CLP [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. All studies used postnatal examination as the reference test, by physical examination or by autopsy. One study did not report about using a reference standard, but the affirmation with the postnatal diagnosis was confirmed after contact with the author [ ]. \n\n\n### Results of individual studies \n  \nThe diagnostic accuracy of MRI in detecting CP is evaluated in this study in terms of the sensitivity and specificity. The results are visualized in Fig.   and Table  .   \nForest plot of all included studies. CI: confidence interval; TP: true positive; FP: false posittive; FN: false negative; TN: true negative \n    \nDistribution of positive and negative diagnoses per study and whether these were predicted correctly with MRI \n  \n\nA combined total of 6 false negative diagnoses were reported in three studies [ ,  ,  ] resulting in a sensitivity of respectively 0.93, 0.97, and 0.92 [ ,  ,  ]. The other five studies had a sensitivity of 1.00 [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ]. All sensitivity confidence intervals were in the range from 0.66 to 1.00. \n\nA total of 10 fetuses received a false positive diagnosis. These diagnoses were made in four different studies and resulted in a specificity of respectively 0.76, 0.50, 0.92, and 0.88 [ ,  ,  ,  ]. The other studies reported no false positive results, corresponding to a specificity of 1.00 [ ,  ,  ,  ]. The specificity confidence intervals ranged from 0.01 to 1.00. The lowest specificity was reported in a study that included two negative cases, from which one case was correctly predicted [ ]. \n\n\n### Homogeneity \n  \nThe tabular results of the homogeneity analysis are included in Fig.  . The forest plot shows that the estimates of the sensitivity lie roughly along the line of the pooled sensitivity (0.966). The Cochrane\u2019s   Q   test statistic is 6.63, df = 7,   p   = 0.47, and the I-square is 0.0%. All three results indicate homogeneity. \n\nFor specificity, the forest plot shows more variation. Not all estimates lie along the line of the pooled specificity (0.94). The Cochrane\u2019s   Q   test statistic is 22.82, df = 7,   p   = 0.00, and the I-square is 69.3%. All specificity results indicate heterogeneity. \n\n\n### Meta-analysis \n  \nThe weighted pooled sensitivity from all eight studies was 0.97 (95% CI 0.928\u20130.988) and is interpreted as excellent. The weighted pooled specificity was 0.94 (0.89\u20130.97) and is interpreted as good to excellent. The sROC is provided in Fig.  . The AUC is 0.98 (95% CI 0.98\u20130.99). This is interpreted as excellent.   \nSummary receiver operating characteristic plot of all included studies. AUC: area under the curve; SE: standard error; Q:   Q  -statistic \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis meta-analysis brings together all available evidence about the diagnostic accuracy of MRI for the prenatal diagnosis of CP. Combining the results of eight studies enabled to more precisely estimate the diagnostic accuracy of MRI, revealing excellent sensitivity and good to excellent specificity. \n\nThe methodological quality of this study is strengthened by the fact that the data collection, extraction, and synthesis were performed separately by two researchers. Also, the broad inclusion criteria used in this study, without additional search filters, contribute to the discovery of almost all available studies [ ]. Furthermore, the power and precision of this study were increased, because a meta-analysis was performed [ ]. However, some limitations are worth noting. \n\nThe reliability of this study was limited, because a small number of studies was included of which most included a relatively small sample size. Also, this meta-analysis does not provide information for subgroup analysis within the selected population. For instance, comparison could not be made between the diagnostic accuracy of isolated CP with CLP, because isolated CP was described in only five fetuses [ ,  ,  ]. One study did not provide information about the total number of isolated CP and CLP diagnosis [ ]. Consequently, the false negative diagnosis and two false positive diagnosis that occurred in this study could not be further analyzed. The other two false positive diagnosis occurred two fetuses with CLP [ ,  ]. The impact of gestational age could also not be explored, because it was not mentioned in one study [ ]. \n\nFurthermore, selection bias might have been caused by the language filter that was used. The search strategy revealed two studies in other languages, one in Czech and one in Chinese [ ,  ]. The language criterion might have caused even more selection bias if other studies did not publish an abstract in English. Additionally, information bias might be present, since the MRI specifications have not been included in the meta-analysis. Although all studies use a 1.5-Tesla MRI, the resolutions of these MRI\u2019s differ. The MRI resolution is likely to influence the diagnostic accuracy, but future research should confirm if a higher resolution contributes to a more accurate diagnosis. \n\nAnother limitation concerns the nature of the heterogeneity. Although the extent of heterogeneity was investigated thoroughly in this study, an assessment of the nature of the heterogeneity was not included in this meta-analysis for two reasons. First, a threshold effect, the primary cause for heterogeneity in diagnostic studies cannot be assessed, because the threshold in MRI assessment is implicit [ ,  ]. It is therefore unclear to what extent study variation is caused by the application of different thresholds. Second, insufficient information is available about population variables and study characteristics to perform meta-regression. For example, the time of the physical examination could have influenced the performance of the reference test and consequently could have caused variation in the estimated diagnostic accuracy [ ]. Since the included studies did not explicitly state the time of the physical examination, this variable could not be included in a meta-regression. \n\nFurther, the reliability of the reference test can be discussed [ ,  ,  ,  ]. For diagnostic studies, it is crucial to have a reference test that accurately determines the presence or absence of the target condition [ ]. Postnatal diagnosis is considered the reference standard in diagnosing CP [ ,  ]. This is performed by thorough physical examination or autopsy. However, some requirements are needed to rely on this diagnosis. The World Health Organization states the importance of visual inspection with a light and with a tongue depressor as part of this physical examination [ ]. In daily practice, if this recommendation is not satisfied, delayed diagnosis of CP is not uncommon [ ]. The studies included in this meta-analysis do not describe the way of performing the postnatal diagnosis and the value of the reference standard could be cause for discussion. Additionally, it is suggested that by gaining more experience with interpreting MRI, interpretation skills significantly improve [ ]. It is unclear to what extent a difference in experience was present in the included studies, and if this difference has led to variation between the studies. \n\nAfter determining the diagnostic accuracy of a test, the applicability needs to be investigated [ ]. This includes assessment of the safety of the test, the availability of materials and expertise, the increased burden of care and cost-effectiveness. First, the increased use of MRI in prenatal diagnoses warrants questions about the safety of this diagnostic instrument, including the possibility of developmental defects due to the exposure to the magnetic radiation [ ]. Two reviews show no harmful effects of MRI performed at 1.5 Tesla and lower [ ,  ]. A 10-year follow-up study including was cited [ ]. This study included 74 pregnant woman and did not reveal significant differences in birth weight between children that were exposed and not exposed to prenatal MRI. However, to our knowledge, the follow-up results have not been published yet. Visualization of fetal structures is more difficult and involves more risks in the first trimester of the pregnancy [ ,  ]. It is advised to avoid performing MRI before 13 weeks gestational age [ ]. The studies included in this meta-analysis performed MRI between 18 and 38 weeks of gestational age, and therefore meet this criterion. Second, performing prenatal MRI requires specific material and expertise, such as knowledge about MRI safety and how to optimize fetal images [ ]. Prenatal MRI is advised therefore to perform in multidisciplinary centers with fetal MRI expertise [ ]. Consequently, the mothers of fetuses at risk for CP will generally need to travel further, to visit a center where the MRI can be performed. Also, the length and costs of the hospital visit will be increased due to this additional diagnostic test. By assessing the applicability of MRI in prenatal diagnoses of CP, alternative options should also be considered. \n\nJust as interest grows in diagnosing CP using prenatal MRI, improving prenatal diagnosis of CP through US techniques also receives attention [ ,  ]. For example, using clinical markers derived from 2D- and 3D sonography is suggested to improve correct diagnosis of CP in the first trimester [ ] and a scoring system has been developed to help sonographers to correctly identify CP [ ]. To summary all US innovations is beyond the scope of this study, but is recommended to be further explored in future research. Cost-effective studies including factors such as availability of equipment and skills are required to determine if MRI should be implemented in the diagnostic process of CP. It is recommended to include subgroups of fetuses in the decision-making process of diagnostic instruments for standard care, such as fetuses with a family risk factor of CP, fetuses with positive US diagnosis, fetuses with or without cleft lip, and fetuses with or without other anomalies. It is therefore not yet recommended to include MRI in standard prenatal care, but MRI could be used in specific cases relying on correct diagnosis. \n\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that MRI is an instrument with excellent sensitivity and good to excellent specificity for diagnosing CP in fetuses at risk for orofacial clefts. Findings indicate that the beneficial effect of performing MRI in this population should not be underestimated, since it provides opportunities to optimize prenatal management and counselling and planning of delivery and postnatal management. Additional research of good methodological quality should assess applicability for clinical care. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 6942582, "text_md5": "ac9c76b6645a9c509301e05d47107833", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 131], "journal": [132, 145], "publication_year": [147, 151], "title": [162, 234], "keywords": [248, 294], "abstract": [307, 1863], "body": [1872, 28405]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 31797081, "doi": "10.1007/s00431-019-03500-x", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6942582", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=6942582"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6942582\">6942582</a>", "list_title": "PMC6942582  Diagnostic accuracy of fetal MRI to detect cleft palate: a meta-analysis"}

However, the results of their relationships were conflicting. This meta-analysis was performed to assess breast cancer frequency associations with background parenchymal enhancement. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nA systematic literature search up to January 2020 was performed to detect studies recording associations between breast cancer frequency and background parenchymal enhancement. We found thirteen studies including 13,788 women at the start with 4046 breast cancer. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between breast cancer frequency and background parenchymal enhancement by the dichotomous technique with a random or fixed-effect model. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWomen with minimal or mild background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging did not have any risk of breast cancer compared to control women (OR, 1.20; 95% CI 0.54\u20132.67). However, high background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging (OR, 2.66; 95% CI 1.36\u20135.19) and moderate (OR, 2.51; 95% CI 1.49\u20134.21) was associated with a significantly higher rate of breast cancer frequency compared to control women. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur meta-analysis showed that the women with high and moderate background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging have higher risks, up to 2.66 fold, of breast cancer. We suggest that women with high or moderate background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging to be scheduled for more frequent follow-up and screening for breast cancer to avoid any complications. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nThe level of normal fibroglandular tissue that enhances the breast magnetic resonance imaging is recognized as background parenchymal enhancement [ ,  ]. Background parenchymal enhancement is related to females hormones and it is reduced post-menopause due to the reduction in these hormones [ ]. \n\nThe American college of radiology breast imaging reporting, and data system, or breast imaging reporting, and data system lexicon categorized background parenchymal enhancement [ ]. Their categories are based on the quantity of fibroglandular tissue, and not the entire breast volume. They are minimal, mild, moderate, and high background parenchymal enhancement [ ]. \n\nThe background parenchymal enhancement data is highly available due to the high number of prescribed breast magnetic resonance imaging for screening and diagnosing breast cancer. Breast magnetic resonance imaging is better to be scheduled at days 7\u201314 through the follicular phase of women's menstrual cycles since background parenchymal enhancement is more noticed in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle [ ,  ]. \n\nRecently, high background parenchymal enhancement was considered as a marker of higher risk of breast cancer in women at high risk e.g. women using an adjuvant endocrine treatment [ \u2013 ]. Also, it was found to detect the efficacy of treatment in some other women e.g. women using neoadjuvant chemotherapy [ ]. \n\nSo, background parenchymal enhancement can be used to improve the early discovery and inhibition of breast cancer [ ]. Though, its associations with breast cancer data are still conflicting. Our meta-analysis aimed to assess the breast cancer frequency association with background parenchymal enhancement. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe present study complied with the meta-analysis of studies in the epidemiology statement [ ], which was performed following an organized protocol. \n\n### Study detection \n  \nIncluded studies were human studies in English language with the association between breast cancer frequency and background parenchymal enhancement in women with and without breast cancer. Excluded studies were commentary, review articles and studies with no measure of an association. Figure\u00a0  shows a schematic diagram of the study process. The articles were integrated into the meta-analysis when the following inclusion criteria were met:   \nThe study was a randomized controlled trial or retrospective study. \n  \nThe target population is women with and without breast cancer. \n  \nThe intervention program was based on assessments of background parenchymal enhancement. \n  \nThe study included women with and without breast cancer. \n    \nSchematic diagram of the study process \n  \n\n\n### Identification \n  \nA protocol of search strategies was prepared according to the PICOS principle [ ], and we defined it as follow: P (population): women with and without breast cancer; I (intervention/exposure): assessments of background parenchymal enhancement; C (comparison): women with compared to without breast cancer; O (outcome): recurrence of giant cell tumor of bone; and S (study design): no restriction [ ]. \n\nA systematic search was performed in OVID, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Google scholar till January 2020, using a blend of keywords \u201cdynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, background parenchymal enhancement and breast cancer\u201d. We gathered all studies detected in an EndNote file, we removed any duplication found and revised the title and abstracts to eliminate studies that did not show any association between breast cancer frequency and background parenchymal enhancement in breast magnetic resonance imaging, based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The remaining studies were examined for any possible association. \n\n\n### Screening \n  \nData were abridged into a stranded form [ ]. If one study contained different data depending on the assessment of the breast cancer frequency and background parenchymal enhancement, they were extracted separately. The selected studies' risk of bias was assessed using the quality in prognosis studies tool, which assesses bias and validity using 6 domains: participation, attrition, prognostic factor measurement, confounding measurement, and account, outcome measurement, and analysis and reporting [ ]. \n\n\n### Eligibility and inclusion \n  \nThe main result concentrated on the breast cancer frequency association with background parenchymal enhancement. Background parenchymal enhancement outcomes were compared in women with and without breast cancer and the overall summary result were prepared to perform the statistical analysis. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nWe used the dichotomous technique with a random-effect model or fixed-effect to compute the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The I  index was calculated; the I  index is from 0 to 100%. When I  was\u2009>\u200950%, we used the random-effect model and when it was\u2009<\u200950%, we used the fixed-effect model. I  index of around 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% respectively specify no, low, moderate, and high heterogeneity [ ]. A subgroup analysis was made by stratifying the assessment per result as outlined previously. In this analysis, a p-value for differences between subgroups of\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. Publication bias was assessed quantitatively with the Egger regression test (publication bias considered present if   p  \u2009\u2265\u20090.05), and qualitatively, by visual examination of funnel plots of the logarithm of odds ratios versus their standard errors [ ]. All p-values were 2 tailed. We use reviewer manager version 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) for all calculations and graphs in this meta-analysis study. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nA total of 2546 unique studies were detected, of which 13 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were used in this meta-analysis study [ ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ]. \n\nThe 13 studies included 13,788 women at the baseline of the study; 4046 of them were breast cancer. All studies had different background parenchymal enhancement categories in women with breast cancer. \n\nStudy size ranged from 32 to 4247 women at the baseline of the study. The number of breast cancer associated with background parenchymal enhancement ranged from 14 to 540. 9 studies reported data stratified women by minimal or mild background parenchymal enhancement (Minimal and mild were represented separately in some studies and together in some studies; consequently we decided to show them here together to avoid any inconsistency); 11 studies were with moderate background parenchymal enhancement; and 11 studies were with high background parenchymal enhancement in association with breast cancers frequency. \n\n8 studies observed higher breast cancer frequency associated with high background parenchymal enhancement and 8 studies with moderate background parenchymal enhancement. The magnitude of the increase of breast cancer frequency was significantly higher in high background parenchymal enhancement than that in moderate background parenchymal enhancement. The effect of background parenchymal enhancement on breast cancer frequency was detected in all populations studied. \n\nWomen with high background parenchymal enhancement had significantly higher breast cancer frequency (OR, 2.66; 95% CI 1.36\u20135.19,   p  \u2009=\u2009004) than that in the normal women with high heterogeneity (I \u2009=\u200984%) as shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Women with moderate background parenchymal enhancement category had significantly high breast cancer frequency (OR, 2.51; 95% CI 1.49\u20134.21,   p  \u2009<\u20090.001) than that in the normal women with high heterogeneity (I \u2009=\u200978%) as shown in Fig.\u00a0 . However, no significant difference was found in Breast cancer frequency between women with minimal or mild background parenchymal enhancement category and normal women (OR, 1.20; 95% CI 0.54\u20132.67,   p  \u2009=\u20090.66) with high heterogeneity (I \u2009=\u200996%) as shown in Fig.\u00a0 . Stratified analysis of selected studies that did and did not adjust for age, and ethnicity of the women and was not done since no studies reported or adjusted for these elements or whether higher background parenchymal enhancement is associated with all cancers or with the special type of cancer.   \nForest plot of the high background parenchymal enhancement associated with breast cancer associated with breast cancer \n    \nForest plot of the moderate background parenchymal enhancement associated with breast cancer associated with breast cancer \n    \nForest plot of the minimal or mild background parenchymal enhancement associated with breast cancer \n  \n\nBased on the visual inspection of the funnel plot as well as on quantitative measurement using the Egger regression test, there was no evidence of publication bias (  p  \u2009=\u20090.88). \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn our meta-analysis study based on 13 studies including 13,788 women at the start with 4046 breast cancer. Women with moderate and high background parenchymal enhancement has up to 2.66-fold higher risk of breast cancer compared to normal women. This effect was detected in all populations [ ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ]. \n\nBackground parenchymal enhancement is chiefly affected by the estrogen hormone. Estrogen hormone affects many systems and organs, including the reproductive system, urinary system, cardiovascular system, bones, skin, hair, and brain. It is believed that background parenchymal enhancement is the radiologically visible form and image of the circulating estrogen hormone in the breast. Besides estrogen hormone, many other factors affect this dynamic enhancement process, such as the amount of contrast material, the patient's hemodynamic status, parameters of magnetic resonance imaging sequences, and vascular anatomy [ ]. \n\nSo, background parenchymal enhancement might be a good tool for improving early discovery and inhibition of breast cancer; since its data is more accessible due to the high number of prescribed breast magnetic resonance imaging for breast cancer screening and diagnosis [ ]. A considerable decrease in background parenchymal enhancement was detected post-risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy [ ,  ]. Also, any variations in background parenchymal enhancement were associated with a higher risk of breast cancer, especially in women with breast cancer gene mutation [ ]. Therefore, the variations in background parenchymal enhancement measurements may be very effective in forecasting the breast cancer frequency in women with breast cancer gene mutations, especially between women with lower or no hormone levels. Though, our meta-analysis study could not answer if background parenchymal enhancement is associated with higher breast cancer frequency in women with breast cancer gene mutations or not. Furthermore, breasts mostly have a suboptimal examination. The examination is suggested in high-risk women to detect any early potential cancer, which may be responsive to good results [ ,  ,  ,  ,  \u2013 ,  \u2013 ]. \n\nA cross-sectional study performed on women with normal risk showed a great association between higher levels of background parenchymal enhancement and breast cancer [ ]. This recommends that the higher levels of background parenchymal enhancement are more often observed in the contralateral healthy breast of women with suspicious lesions on the other side at magnetic resonance imaging [ ]. \n\nNone of the selected studies reported an association between age, and ethnicity, and breast cancer frequency. Also, none of the studies answered whether higher background parenchymal enhancement is associated with all cancers or with a specific subtype of cancer. However, from the study results presented here, we recommend increasing the use background parenchymal enhancement for detection of the risk of breast cancer to oppose the possible negative outcome as early as possible. \n\n### Limitations \n  \nThere may be selection bias in this study since so many of the studies found were excluded from the meta-analysis. However, the studies excluded did not satisfy the inclusion criteria of our meta-analysis. \n\nMinimal and mild were represented separately in some studies and together in some studies. So we presented them together here. Maybe if we studied each one alone we could have a significant effect of mild associated with breast cancer but the number of studies that showed them separately was small to conduct a meta-analysis. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nOur meta-analysis showed that the women with high and moderate background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging have an association with up to 2.66 fold risk of breast cancer compared to normal women. Background parenchymal enhancement can serve as a tool to improve fast discovery and inhibition of breast cancer. We suggest that women with high or moderate background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging to be scheduled for more frequent follow up and screening for breast cancer to avoid any complications. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7893738, "text_md5": "613f1f5949062315297151123082b535", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 117], "journal": [118, 133], "publication_year": [135, 139], "title": [150, 256], "keywords": [270, 406], "abstract": [419, 2181], "body": [2190, 15201]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 33607959, "doi": "10.1186/s12880-021-00566-8", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893738", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7893738"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893738\">7893738</a>", "list_title": "PMC7893738  Breast cancer and background parenchymal enhancement at breast magnetic resonance imaging: a meta-analysis"}

Previous studies reporting the diagnostic performance of SW-MRI and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of calcifications are inconsistent and based on single-institution designs. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis on SW-MRI, determining the potential of SW-MRI to detect calcifications. Two independent investigators searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science for eligible diagnostic accuracy studies, which were published until March 24, 2017 and investigated the accuracy of SW-MRI to detect calcifications, using computed tomography (CT) as a reference. The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess study quality and methods for analysis were based on PRISMA. A bivariate diagnostic random-effects model was applied to obtain pooled sensitivities and specificities. Out of the 4629 studies retrieved by systematic literature search, 12 clinical studies with 962 patients and a total of 1,032 calcifications were included. Pooled sensitivity was 86.5% (95%-confidence interval (CI): 73.6\u201393.7%) for SW-MRI and 36.7% (95%\u2013CI:29.2\u201344.8%) for standard MRI. Pooled specificities of SW-MRI (90.8%; 95%\u2013CI:81.0\u201395.8%) and standard MRI (94.2; 95%\u2013CI:88.9\u201396.7%) were comparable. Results of the present meta-analysis suggest, that SW-MRI is a reliable method for detecting calcifications in soft tissues. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nCalcifications can be prognostic markers in a variety of locations or tissues . CT is currently used as the reference standard for the detection of calcifications. However, it is associated with the disadvantage of exposing patients to ionizing radiation. Standard MRI, on the other hand, is radiation-free, but insensitive to calcifications . \n\nSW-MRI, which is gradually being adapted into clinical practice, has shown the potential to overcome this drawback of MRI. It is a high spatial resolution MRI gradient echo (GRE) technique, relying on susceptibility differences between tissues to produce a contrast different from T1, T2 and T2* weighted images . While most clinically used MR sequences mainly use the information derived from magnitude images and discard the phase information , the development of phase filters has enabled the removal of artefacts and the generation of a tissue contrast based on local susceptibility differences. The filtered phase image is useful to differentiate between diamagnetic (e.g. calcium) and paramagnetic (e.g. blood products, iron) compounds and to identify calcifications . In the years since its introduction, it has been suggested that SW-MRI can offer additional diagnostic information across a wide spectrum of pathologies without radiation exposure . \n\nPrevious studies reporting the diagnostic performance of SW-MRI and MRI for the detection of calcifications are partly inconsistent and based on single-institution designs. To date, there has been no systematic and qualitative synthesis of this evidence. \n\nTherefore, we sought to compare and determine the potential of SW-MRI for detecting calcifications in brain and body soft tissues. More specifically, we proposed the following explicit statement of questions (PICO): Patients with intracranial or extracranial calcifications; Index test of SW-MRI used to identify calcifications and differentiate it from other tissues; if direct Comparison to standard MRI was performed in the same patients, this data will also be extracted and used for comparison; Outcome (presence or absence of calcifications) was assessed based on the reference standard CT. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nA Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart  was used to report the decisions made in the course of the study selection process (see Supplementary Information\u00a0  and see Fig.\u00a0  for the study selection flowchart). Overall, 12 suitable clinical studies were identified and included in the present meta-analysis . See Supplementary Information\u00a0  for a list of studies, which were excluded at the level of full-text search, including the individual reason for exclusion.   \nStudy selection flowchart. \n  \n\n### Patient and study characteristics \n  \nIn total, 962 patients (male\u2009=\u2009554, female\u2009=\u2009257, sex unknown\u2009=\u2009151) were included with an average age of 52.2 years. MRI and CT examinations were performed within a period of 0.5 to 90 days. All the studies were single-centre and study design was described as prospective in six of the studies, as retrospective in five of the studies and remained unclear in one case. Six of the studies were performed on 1.5T scanners, five of the studies at 3T and one of the studies was performed at both 1.5 and 3T. The characteristics of the patients and studies included in this meta-analysis are provided in Table\u00a0 .   \nStudy Characteristics of the Included Studies. \n  \nNote. \u2013 N/A\u2009=\u2009data not available. \n  \n\n\n### Quality assessment \n  \nThe detailed results of the QUADAS-2 (QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) evaluation of the methodologic quality (risk of bias and concerns regarding applicability) are presented in Fig.\u00a0 . The majority of the studies were assessed as having low concerns regarding applicability. Methods of reconstruction and especially the interpretation of the CT and MRI scans were poorly described. In five of the studies the risk of bias for patient selection was unclear due to incomplete reporting on the methods of patient selection. Risk of bias related to the conduction of the index test or the reference standard was unclear in eight or seven of the studies, as no information was provided on whether the radiologists were blinded to the reference standard or the index test. Several studies did not describe, if there was an appropriate interval between the interpretation of the index test(s) and the reference standard . The time intervals given ranged from less than 24\u2009hours to three months. For one patient, the interval between the MRI and the CT examination was 10 months, because of which the corresponding study was rated as having a high risk of bias related to flow and timing.   \nQUADAS-2 assessment of study quality. Grouped bar charts of the QUADAS-2 scores are expressed as percentage of the 12 included studies meeting each criterion. For each domain, the proportion of the included studies that indicate low/high/unclear concerns of applicability or risk of bias are displayed in light grey\u2009=\u2009\u201cyes\u201d answers (good quality), dark grey bar\u2009=\u2009\u201cunclear\u201d answers, and medium bar\u2009=\u2009\u201cno\u201d answers (low quality). \n  \n\n\n### Assessment of calcifications \n  \nThe diagnostic performance of SW-MRI for the identification of calcifications was analysed in all studies. The resulting forest plots of the log diagnostic odds ratios are given in Fig.\u00a0 . Table\u00a0  provides an overview of the detailed results for sensitivities and specificities. The pooled sensitivity for SW-MRI was 86.5% (95% CI: 73.6\u201393.7%) and the pooled specificity was 90.8% (95% CI: 81.0\u201395.8%). sROC curves of overall diagnostic accuracy for SW-MRI and MRI are provided in Fig.\u00a0 . The area under the curve (AUC) for SW-MRI was 0.95 (MRI: 0.78). Especially for standard MRI, the extrapolation of the sROC curve is highly vulnerable to outliers.   \nForest plots showing the log diagnostic odds ratios (black squares) for susceptibility weighted imaging and standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (where available) of each study with 95% confidence intervals (horizontal lines).

An effect size of zero is indicated by the vertical dashed line. \n    \nOverview of the True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives and False Negatives for SW-MRI and MRI. \n  \nNotes. \u2013 N/A\u2009=\u2009data not available, SW-MRI\u2009=\u2009Susceptibility weighted magnetic resonance imaging. \n    \nSummary ROC curves of overall diagnostic accuracy for susceptibility weighted magnetic resonance imaging (SW-MRI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (  A  ), for the overall diagnostic accuracy of SW-MRI (  B  ) and the overall diagnostic accuracy of MRI (  C  ). The false positive rate (1-specificity) is plotted against the false positive rate (1-specificity). The sROC curves show a deviation of the data points and especially for standard MRI, the extrapolation of the sROC curve is highly vulnerable to outliners. \n  \n\nIn half of the studies  direct comparison to standard MRI was performed with a pooled sensitivity of 36.7% (95% CI: 29.2\u201344.8%) and a pooled specificity of 94.2% (95% CI: 88.9\u201396.7%). \n\nThe marginally lower specificity of SW-MRI compared to standard MRI is most likely to be explained by the inverse proportional relationship of sensitivity and specificity. \n\nTo evaluate, if the differences observed between standard MRI and SW-MRI were significant, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Sensitivity and specificity differed significantly for MRI and SW-MRI, when the imaging method was added as a covariate (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). \n\nThe data retrievable from Zhu   et al  .  only permitted the calculation of the sensitivity for the detection of calcifications and could thus not be included into the bivariate model. \n\nIn the study by Chen   et al  . , SW-MRI was compared against quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), whereby SW-MRI showed a significantly lower diagnostic performance. \n\n\n### Heterogeneity and publication bias \n  \nThe\u00a0Chi-squared test suggested heterogeneous results for SW-MRI (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for sensitivity and for specificity) and also partly for MRI (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for sensitivity; p\u2009=\u20090.11 for specificity). Covariate analysis could only explain part of the observed heterogeneity. Adding the location of the lesion (intracranial/body) as a covariate to the model showed the greatest effect on the variability estimates for SW-MRI, whereby adding \u201cintracranial\u201d as a covariate decreased variability estimates from 1.12 and 1.09 (for sensitivity and specificity) to 1.04 and 0.89. \n\nConsidering the relatively small number of studies included in the present meta-analysis (n\u2009=\u200912), funnel plots and regression tests of asymmetry based on it may be inconclusive as a tool for detecting publication bias . Although the regression test of asymmetry revealed a negative test result (p\u2009=\u20090.45 for SW-MRI and p\u2009=\u20090.19 for standard MRI), this cannot necessarily be taken as indicator of a low probability of publication bias. Especially with regard to standard MRI, with only six studies evaluating the performance of both SW-MRI and standard MRI, publication bias cannot be excluded. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nMajor advances in MRI have led to the recent development of SW-MRI, which has opened the door to an improved non-invasive detection of even small amounts of calcification and haemorrhage. Over the last decade, several literature reviews on SW-MRI have been published , but to date there has been no systematic approach, critically evaluating and combining the results of comparable studies. \n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to focus on the diagnostic performance of SW-MRI for the detection of calcifications. Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates for SW-MRI were high. In the studies, that evaluated the performance of both standard MRI and SW-MRI, above two times more patients could be correctly assessed with SW-MRI compared to standard MRI. \n\nTraditionally, CT is considered the reference standard for the detection of calcifications. However, it is associated with radiation exposure and accounts for the majority of the radiation exposure related to medical imaging . This is especially relevant in children and younger patients, who are at a higher risk of developing radiation-induced tumors, infertility and other side effects, and in patients facing multiple follow-up examinations. Therefore, the reduction of radiation dose has become a major concern in clinical routine. \n\nIn this context, SW-MRI can offer an alternative radiation-free approach. Its development began in the 1990s with the introduction of \u201cphase imaging\u201d as a means to map susceptibility. After the acquisition of the magnitude and phase images, raw phase images are unwrapped and further processed, usually by transformation into a phase mask, which is then multiplied by the magnitude image . Advances in phase unwrapping and background phase removal have been among the key steps to reduce artifacts and enhance tissue phase contrast. Over the years, various unwrapping and post-processing techniques such as Fourier-based unwrapping, Homodyne-filtering, Gaussian filtering and phase-unwrapping high-pass filtering have been developed in order to reduce artifacts and to enhance the susceptibility contrast . So far, there have only been a limited number of studies comparing the performance of the different post-processing approaches and the influence of different filter types, but a recent study suggested, that phase wrapping followed by high-pass filtering might perform most accurately . \n\nThe fields of clinical application for SW-MRI include the imaging of venous blood in acute or chronic ischemia, the visualization of the vascularization, haemorrhage and calcification of tumors, the identification of epilepsy-associated calcified and vascular abnormalities and measuring calcification or iron deposition in neurodegenerative diseases . It has been indicated that with regard to the differentiation between small calcification and haemorrhage, SW-MRI might even be superior to the reference standard CT, as due to a considerable overlap of attenuation values these conditions are not always easy to distinguish on CT scans . \n\nBesides brain imaging, possible clinical applications of SW-MRI have also been extended to other areas, among which belong the detection of prostatic calcification , the identification of calcific tendonitis  and subacromial spurs  as well as the visualization of peripheral vessel calcifications . \n\nDepending on their location and pattern, calcifications can hint at various pathologies. In the brain, calcification is a very important factor in the diagnosis of brain neoplasms. As different tumors show overlapping features in different diagnostic imaging modalities, detecting whether a tumor is associated with calcifications is useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Tumors frequently showing intratumoral calcification include oligodendrogliomas, meningiomas, craniopharyngiomas, pineal gland tumors and ependymomas . For prostate cancer, which has become one of the major challenges to public health, the identification of prostatic calcifications and differentiation from haemorrhage is an important diagnostic step, as the reliable detection of haemorrhage can be used as a biomarker for cancerous tissue . Prostatic calcifications can indicate several urological diseases and symptoms such as underlying inflammation . Within rotator cuff tendons, calcium deposition is a diagnostic clue for calcific tendonitis . In vessels, calcifications can be a sign of advanced stages of atherosclerosis . With regard to vessel calcifications and the imaging of complex plaque features with intraplaque haemorrhage and/or inflammation, SW-MRI has advantages over conventional imaging techniques by being able to detect even small foci of haemorrhage and to differentiate them from calcification . \n\nThe various possible clinical applications of SW-MRI for detecting calcifications are also displayed by the studies included in the present meta-analysis: Pertaining to the neuroaxis, the aims of the original studies included the general detection and differentiation of intracranial calcifications by susceptibility weighted magnetic resonance imaging (SW-MRI) such as in the studies by Barbosa, Chen, Gronemeyer, Yamada and Zhu   et al  ., the specific assessment of pineal gland calcifications (Adams   et al  .), of epilepsy-associated calcifications (Saini   et al  .) and of intratumoral calcifications in intracranial gliomas (Berberat   et al  . and Zulfiqar   et al  .) . Pertaining to the body-axis, Bai and Dou   et al  . aimed to show the diagnostic performance of SW-MRI for the specific detection of prostatic calcifications and Yang   et al  . wished to demonstrate the usefulness of SW-MRI for the assessment of vessel wall calcifications in major peripheral arteries . The common primary endpoint of all included studies was the detection of calcium-phosphate deposition in brain and body soft tissues. \n\nThe present meta-analysis has several limitations. First, the number of studies that met our inclusion criteria was relatively low, whereby the small study size is especially relevant with regard to MRI. Therefore, no subgroup analyses were performed, as the sample size was considered too small to obtain reliable results. Also, the included studies were heterogeneous, e.g. regarding the size of the study populations and the location and type of the calcifications, whereby covariate analysis could only explain part of this heterogeneity. Furthermore, not all authors provided sufficient information about the study design and the assessment of the index text and/or the reference standard. Another aspect is, that possible bias could have resulted from the facts that inclusion criteria were not standardized and that the studies were conducted in different clinical settings. Although CT is considered the best imaging technique for the detection of calcifications, the additional use of histopathology to confirm the diagnosis would have been superior, but was only applied in two of the studies . A further limitation is, that covering a large time period, this meta-analysis includes studies with different algorithms and post-processing techniques. While the SW-MRI image contrast is relatively consistent, the quality of SW-MRI images naturally depends on the robustness and accuracy of the post-processing on the phase image . Therefore, the quality of the image data in the present meta-analysis may differ. Also, due to the variance in diagnostic performance and the relatively small number of data points, the extrapolation of the sROC curve is highly vulnerable to outliners, especially for standard MRI; and assumptions on significant differences between standard MRI and SW-MRI cannot be made solely based on the sROC curves. Furthermore, the SW-MRI phase image has the disadvantage of aliasing if the field is large enough so that the phase exceeds \u03c0 radians, which makes it difficult to obtain the exact shape and extent of especially larger calcifications . Finally, we did not include grey literature, but only published studies, which might cause a selection bias, as potentially unpublished data could have shown unexpected results, because of which it might not have been intended for publication or may not have met the journal\u2019s criteria. \n\nAs SW-MRI does not enable quantitative measurements, new susceptibility-based techniques, such as QSM, are currently developed and implemented . QSM has shown the potential for more accurate measurements of total volume and susceptibility and may thus be a solution for quantifying calcification or haemorrhage on MR images . So far, there have only been a limited number of studies published on the diagnostic performance of QSM in the detection of calcifications, which suggested a convincing sensitivity and specificity . In a comparison study of SW-MRI and QSM, Chen   et al  . showed, that QSM might achieve a higher sensitivity and specificity than SW-MRI (80.5% vs. 71% and 93.5% vs. 76.5%) in the detection of intracranial calcifications. Therefore, QSM may play a significant role in the future applications of SW-MRI and may enable a reliable differentiation and detection of soft tissue calcium deposits in various clinical applications, with initial clinical evidence affirming its effectiveness and its potential superiority to SW-MRI. However, more studies are warranted for confirmation. \n\nIn conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that SW-MRI is a reliable technique for the detection of calcifications with an accuracy close to CT. Studies that evaluated the performance of both standard MRI and SW-MRI suggested, that the diagnostic performance of SW-MRI was superior to standard MRI. However, further large, multi-centre and prospective studies are required in order to confirm these findings. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \nThe present meta-analysis is in accordance with the guidelines provided by the PRISMA  (see checklist). The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; registration number CRD42017059736). Only studies using SW-MRI for the detection of calcifications with CT as the standard of reference were identified. The literature search was performed using Pubmed (MEDLINE), OvidSP (EMBASE) and Web of Science (ISI). The present meta-analysis is exempt from ethical approval of the Institutional Review Board, as the analysis only involves de-identified data and all the included prospective studies have received local ethics approval. \n\n### Search Strategy and study selection \n  \nA comprehensive literature search was performed based on the following combination of MeSH terms and keywords for a PubMed database search: ((SWI[All Fields] AND (\u201cmagnetics\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR \u201cmagnetics\u201d[All Fields] OR \u201cmagnetic\u201d[All Fields])) OR ((\u201cdisease susceptibility\u201d[MeSH Terms] OR (\u201cdisease\u201d[All Fields] AND \u201csusceptibility\u201d[All Fields]) OR \u201cdisease susceptibility\u201d[All Fields] OR \u201csusceptibility\u201d[All Fields]) AND weighted[All Fields]) OR (\u201cquantitative susceptibility\u201d[All Fields] AND \u201ccalcification\u201d[All Fields])) OR (\u201cphase image\u201d[All Fields] AND \u201ccalcification\u201d[All Fields]). Corresponding keywords were used for OvidSP and Web of Science data search. \n\nAll published original study designs in English or German language, that used SW-MRI for the detection of calcifications, were considered eligible. The final search was conducted on March 24, 2017. After the removal of duplicates, the retrieved titles and abstracts were independently scanned by two investigators and, with regard to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, either discarded or retained for further evaluation. Full text versions of relevant studies were extracted for further in depth evaluation. The reference lists of all included studies were checked manually in order to identify other relevant papers. In some studies, only a subset of the patients met the inclusion criteria and only these were included.   Inclusion criteria   were as follows: \n\n(a)\u2002Human patients with calcifications. \n\n(b)\u2002Use of unenhanced susceptibility-weighted MRI as the index test for the detection of calcifications. \n\n(c)\u2002Results of the index test being verified against the reference standard CT. \n\n(d)\u2002Data retrievable to calculate a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 table (or sufficient data to calculate either sensitivity or specificity). \n\n(e)\u2002Reporting of >5 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. \n\nStudies were excluded if they included overlapping samples. If the patient sample data was published in more than one publication, the latest study with the largest patient sample was selected and the duplicate study was removed. \n\n\n### Data extraction and quality assessment \n  \nData were independently extracted by two authors, by use of standardized data extraction sheets. The extracted data included information on: First author, journal and year of publication, the number of (included) patients, patient age (mean, standard deviation, range), false positives/negatives and true positives/negatives for SW-MRI and MRI (if available), the number of patients excluded (because of study overlap, different index test, no or different reference standard), technical parameters of CT and MRI imaging, absolute attenuation threshold used to differentiate calcification from other tissues in CT. Studies with multiple readers and different numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives were averaged in order to obtain study-level data and, if necessary, rounded to the nearest whole number. All ensuing disagreements were resolved by consensus. \n\nThe QUADAS-2 tool was used. It comprises four domains, which are patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing , which are assessed in terms of risk of bias and concerns regarding applicability. A time span of three months was considered an acceptable interval between MRI and CT imaging, given the slow progression of calcifications. The tool was applied to all studies by two independent investigators. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. \n\n\n### Statistics and data analysis \n  \nData was exported as comma separated values and further processed using \u2018R\u2019 Statistical Software (Version 3.2.2, R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria, 2016). Data from the 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 tables was summarized in forest plots for each study. Forest plots of log diagnostic odds ratios were generated along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Since some of the 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 tables included zero cells, a continuity correction of 0.5 was done prior to regression analysis. The bivariate diagnostic random-effects model by Reitsma   et al  .  was used to compare pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity for the index tests (SW-MRI, standard MRI, if available). Pairs of sensitivity and specificity are analysed together, whereby any correlation that might exist between the two measures could be added to the bivariate model and result in separate effects on the sensitivity and specificity . The standard output of this bivariate model includes the pooled logit sensitivity and specificity values with 95% confidence intervals. The summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curve was constructed and areas under the curve (AUC), which were calculated by use of bivariate models, showed the diagnostic performance of SW-MRI and standard MRI for the detection of calcifications. To assess whether significant heterogeneity, in the form of variance between the study estimates of sensitivity and specificity, was present, a chi-squared test (\u03c7 ) was performed. A covariate analysis was employed to further investigate sources of heterogeneity. To investigate publication bias, a regression test of asymmetry was performed . A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Meta-analytical data evaluation and creation of the graphs was performed using the freely available package \u2018mada\u2019 (version 0.5.7) . \n\n\n### Data availability \n  \nThe datasets generated or analyzed in the course of the present meta-analysis can be requested from the corresponding author.

The aim of this study was to determine the extent of progressive cortical gray matter volume changes over time in schizophrenia, their site and time of occurrence, and the role of potential moderators of brain changes. English language articles published between 1 January 1983 and 31 March 2012 in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing changes in cortical gray matter volume over time between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls were included. Hedges   g   was calculated for each study. Analyses were performed using fixed- and random-effects models. A subgroup analysis was run to explore the pattern of brain changes in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. A meta-regression statistic was adopted to investigate the role of potential moderators of the effect sizes (ESs). A total of 19 studies, analyzing 813 patients with schizophrenia and 718 healthy controls, were included. Over time, patients with schizophrenia showed a significantly higher volume loss of total cortical gray matter, left superior temporal gyrus (STG), left anterior STG, left Heschl gyrus, left planum temporale and posterior STG bilaterally. Meta-analysis of first-episode schizophrenic patients showed a more significant pattern of progressive loss of whole cerebral gray matter volume involving the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, and left Heschl gyrus compared with healthy controls. Clinical, pharmacologic and neuroradiological variables were found to be significant moderators of brain volume changes in patients with schizophrenia. The meta-analysis demonstrates that progressive cortical gray matter changes in schizophrenia occur with regional and temporal specificity. The underlying pathological process appears to be especially active in the first stages of the disease, affects the left hemisphere and the superior temporal structures more and is at least partly moderated by the type of pharmacological treatment received. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMultiple brain abnormalities in schizophrenia have been demonstrated by a large number of computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in the past 40 years and confirmed by a series of meta-analytic reviews.  A 3% decrease in whole brain volume has been found in patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy individuals; decreases were more prominent for gray matter (2%) than for white matter (1%).  The pathomorphological findings most commonly demonstrated by region of interest (ROI) MRI studies include enlargement of the ventricular system and reduction in the volume of cortical and subcortical gray matter of frontal and temporal lobes and the limbic system.  A more detailed examination of regional brain structural changes has been achieved by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies.  Meta-analytical reviews have consistently shown that schizophrenia is associated with a reduction in gray matter volume, indicating the anterior cingulate, thalamus, frontal lobe, hippocampal\u2013amygdala region,  superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left medial temporal lobe gray matter as key regions of structural deficits. \n\nThe nature and meaning of such brain abnormalities, their time of occurrence and whether they are static or progressive have been investigated by cross-sectional comparisons of patients with first-episode and chronic schizophrenia and by a number of within-subject longitudinal MRI studies.  A recent meta-analysis of longitudinal controlled MRI studies demonstrated a significantly higher volume reduction of whole brain gray matter and enlargement of lateral ventricles in patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy controls,  thus supporting the notion that schizophrenia is associated with progressive loss of cerebral tissue. Cortical gray matter appears particularly sensitive to change. \n\nGiven its consistent involvement in studies on brain pathology of schizophrenia and in most of the pathophysiological hypotheses of the disorder,  and also its functional relevance and implications in clinical\u2013pathological association studies,  gray matter has been a focus of special attention in research on the time course of brain structural changes and their clinical significance. However, despite the extensive work carried out, debate on the time of occurrence of gray matter changes in schizophrenia and whether they progress over time is ongoing, and factors facilitating or preventing such progression are still largely unknown. The available literature data  do not allow a conclusion on whether the observed pattern of progressive changes in gray matter affects the brain uniformly or involves discrete cortical areas. Moreover, it is now well recognized that the effect of potential confounding factors such as pharmacological treatment and brain aging have to be taken into account in morphological investigations of brain volume changes over time, especially in the case of cerebral gray matter.  Several studies have indicated that treatment with typical antipsychotics may increase basal ganglia volume, and reduce cortical gray matter in different brain regions,  whereas atypical antipsychotics have been found not only to reduce  but also to retain or even increase  cortical gray matter volume over time.  A number of studies concluded that there is evidence for accelerated loss of gray matter in schizophrenia compared with healthy individuals  and such brain volume changes may be especially prominent in the first years of illness. \n\nA meta-analysis of all published studies can facilitate the understanding of the progression of cortical gray matter abnormalities in schizophrenia. We were interested in answering the following questions: Are gray matter abnormalities in schizophrenia progressive? Does progression uniformly affect different brain areas and structures? When progression occurs in the course of the disease? Are there differences in time and rate of such progression for different brain regions? Are there significant moderators of progression and do they differ for the different brain structures? Is there evidence of a different moderating role of first- versus second-generation antipsychotic (FGA versus SGA) treatment on such progression? To provide answer to these questions, we performed a series of updated quantitative meta-analyses of available studies that analyzed cerebral gray matter changes in schizophrenia with a longitudinal controlled design, including both the analysis of cortical subregions crucially involved in the pathophysiology of the disease not previously meta-analyzed and a subgroup analysis on studies conducted in first-episode patients, which allowed us to make inferences on the site and timing of cortical gray matter changes in schizophrenia. Finally, a series of meta-regressions were conducted to explore potential moderators of the effects detected. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Data sources \n  \nA systematic search was used to identify relevant studies. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched using the following Medical Subject Heading categories: ([Magnetic Resonance Imaging] OR [MRI]) AND [schizophrenia] AND ([longitudinal] OR [progressive] OR [follow-up]) for peer-reviewed English language articles published between 1 January 1983 (when the first MRI study on schizophrenia was conducted ) and 31 March 31 2012. A systematic literature search using the Medical Subject Headings: ([Magnetic Resonance Imaging] OR [or MRI]) AND [psychosis] AND ([longitudinal] OR [progressive] OR [follow-up]) was also carried out to identify peer-reviewed English language articles published from 1 January 1983 to 31 March 2012 conducted with a longitudinal design comparing schizophrenia with other psychotic disorders and control groups. All the reference lists of the selected studies were reviewed to check for other references not found in the systematic search. \n\n\n### Database study selection \n  \nMRI studies that used ROI volumetric analysis of cerebral cortical gray matter and longitudinally analyzed its change over time in a group of schizophrenic patients and a group of healthy controls were included in the meta-analyses. Only studies that investigated patients with a formal diagnosis of schizophrenia were included. Longitudinal MRI studies on patients diagnosed as at-risk mental state for schizophrenia or during transition to psychosis were not considered for the present meta-analysis. Studies that investigated childhood-onset schizophrenia were included. Case studies, reviews, abstracts and unpublished reports were not considered. Investigations using VBM, deformation-based morphometry or tensor-based methods for measuring regional brain volumes were also excluded. We decided to focus our investigation on ROI studies because we aimed to analyze absolute brain volumes of discrete cortical regions with well-defined anatomical landmarks and brain tissue segmentation procedures. We decided not to include other indices of regional gray matter amount abnormalities derived from whole brain or cortical surface analysis, such as VBM and tensor-based methods, as they are not comparable with ROI volume measures and as they suffer from several potential biases (that is, different spatial normalization, tissue classification and spatial smoothing procedures between studies) that could be over-emphasized in a meta-analytical study. Moreover, unlike traditional meta-analyses, the Anatomical Likelihood Estimation approach (the golden standard for VBM meta-analyses) does not incorporate information from nonsignificant findings, thus allowing to analyze only those findings reported as statistically significant, which may lead to a relevant bias in performing meta-analysis. When repeat studies by the same research group were available, and the patients included in one study were included in a subsequent study, only the most recent or larger study was included, with the exception of data relative to brain regions investigated only in the earlier or larger study from the same group. This criterion was followed for each of the cerebral regions examined. Studies performed using MRI were considered if they reported quantitative measurements of the change in volume over time of cerebral structures in terms of means and standard deviations (s.d.) or as a variable that could lead back to such values (for example, standard error (s.e.) values). According to Furukawa   et al.  ,  missing s.d.'s were calculated from the group of studies using the same outcome variables. If studies presented male and female subjects separately, we entered the results as if they were from two separate studies, a technique adopted by previous meta-analyses of MRI volumes in schizophrenia.  Studies reporting qualitative or subjective assessments were not considered. Studies that used linear measurements were also excluded in view of the lower reliability of such measurements compared with three-dimensional measurements. \n\n\n### Data recorded in the database \n  \nThe following data were extracted from the chosen studies: number of subjects and percentage of males in the study sample; age of the patient at first MRI measurement (mean, s.d. or range, in years); duration of illness at the time of the first MRI (mean, s.d. or range, in years); interval between the two MRI scans (duration of follow-up) (mean or range, in months); type of antipsychotic medications taken during the MRI scan interval; Tesla value of the MRI scanner; MRI slice thickness (in mm); year of publication of the study; percentage change in brain tissue volume (((volume at follow-up\u2212volume at baseline)/volume at baseline) \u00d7 100) (mean and s.d. or s.e.) in patients with schizophrenia and in healthy comparison group or volume (in ml) of a given cerebral structure analyzed at baseline and at follow-up scans (mean and s.d. or s.e.) in patients with schizophrenia and controls. The percent change in volume was selected to estimate the ES. If this measure was not reported, the percent change in volume over time in each study was calculated by the authors (LDP and AV) using the following formula: ((volume at follow-up\u2212volume at baseline)/volume at baseline) \u00d7 100. \n\n\n### Identification of brain regions included in the meta-analysis \n  \nTo avoid bias in selecting brain regions for the meta-analysis, we recorded all cortical gray matter regions investigated by the studies included in the database. For some regions, a few studies reported left and right measurements separately, but others reported the total combined volume. In this meta-analysis, the left, right and total measurements were treated as separate measures. To ensure that the analyses were sufficiently powered, we analyzed only those cortical regions for which at least three studies were available. \n\n\n### Meta-analytical methods and data analysis \n  \nMeta-analyses were carried out using the comprehensive meta-analysis software, version 2 (Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA). The ES was calculated for each study included in the meta-analyses. As a measure of ES, Hedges'   g   was adopted, that is, the difference between the means of the patient and control groups, divided by the s.d. and weighted for sample size, to correct for bias from small sample sizes.  This metric is commonly used in meta-analyses and is representative of the difference in structural measurements between the control and patient distribution as indicated by the formula: \n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\nand \n\n\n\nwhere   X   is the raw score,   M   is the mean and   N   is the number of cases. \n\nAccording to the classification adopted by Cohen,  an ES of 0.8 is considered large, an ES of 0.5 is considered moderate and an ES of 0.2 is considered small. The 95% interval around the composite ES was also calculated.  To determine whether the studies could reasonably be described as sharing a common ES, a homogeneity (Cochran   Q  ) test of the ES was performed for each meta-analysis.  When a statistically significant heterogeneity between studies was observed, the source of such heterogeneity was investigated by testing the influence of potential moderators of the ES. The   I   statistic (the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity) was adopted to aid interpretability of between-study heterogeneity.   I   values range from 0 to 100% values of 25%, 50% and 75% represent low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively.  The pooled ES was calculated by means of a fixed-effect model when the   Q   test was not significant, or random-effect model in case of significant between-studies heterogeneity. Egger's test of publication bias was used to assess whether there was a tendency for selective publication of studies based on the nature and direction of their results. \n\nFor analysis of ES, the minimum level of significance was set at 0.05. In fact, each meta-analysis for any specific area should be regarded as an independent analysis. Since a single measure for each analysis is included, a correction for multiple comparisons would be virtually not applicable or redundant and too susceptible to type II error. \n\n\n### Subgroup meta-analysis \n  \nTo assess whether the findings of our analysis were confirmed or not at different time points of the lifetime trajectory of schizophrenia, a supplementary set of meta-analyses was conducted by selecting from our database those studies that investigated first-episode patients only, and analyzing them separately. To ensure that the analyses were sufficiently powered, we analyzed only those cortical regions for which at least three studies were available. \n\n\n### Meta-regression analysis of demographic, clinical, treatment, neuroradiological and study quality variables \n  \nFor those cerebral structures for which a statistically significant between-studies heterogeneity was detected, meta-regression analyses were conducted to test the influence of certain potential moderators of ES. To avoid type I errors, demographic and clinical variables were chosen based on key clinical questions and the availability of the variables in the studies. The following moderators were considered: percentage of male patients in the study; mean age of patients at baseline; duration of illness at first MRI scan; age at onset of the disease; MRI slice thickness; and percentage of patients using atypical antipsychotics. The latter was adopted because only a small minority of studies detailed the amount of antipsychotic drugs taken between scans. The number of Tesla was not considered since all studies were performed with scanners of the same magnetic field magnitude (1.5\u2009T). \n\nWe also tested whether the ES was modulated by the quality of the studies. Study quality was scored in six key areas by two independent investigators (LDP and AV), with disputes resolved by consensus. One point was given for each of the following categories: age matching (not stated/significant difference=0; matched=1), sex matching (not stated/significant difference=0; matched=1), control subjects with no psychiatric illness (not stated=0; no psychiatric illness=1), same MRI scanner and sequence at each follow-up time point for each subject (different scanner or sequence=0; same scanner and sequence=1), good reliability of measures (intraclass correlation coefficient/  k  <0.8/not stated=0; intraclass correlation coefficient/  k\u2a7e  0.8=1) and small slice thickness (\u2a7e4\u2009mm=0; >1.5\u2009mm and <4\u2009mm=0.5; and \u2a7d1.5\u2009mm=1). \n\nFor analysis of the effects of moderators, the minimum level of significance was set again at 0.05. In fact, meta-regressions were intended to be exploratory analyses with the aim to generate hypotheses, to be tested in new primary studies, and correction for multiple comparisons would have been unduly conservative. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Results of the systematic search \n  \nThe selection procedure is shown in  . A total of 19 studies were identified as suitable for analysis ( ). The following cerebral regions (gray matter), for which at least three studies were available, were included in the analyses: whole brain, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, right and left STG, right and left anterior STG, right and left posterior STG, right and left Heschl gyrus (HG) and right and left planum temporale (PT). \n\nAll studies analyzed patients with schizophrenia, but some also included patients with related diagnoses. van Haren   et al.   included diagnoses of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder; Keshavan   et al.  ,  Lieberman   et al.   and Boonstra   et al.   included diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder and schizoaffective disorder. Reig   et al.   included patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, psychotic mood disorder and atypical psychosis. In these studies, the percentage of patients with schizophrenia ranged from 50  to 96%. \n\nFrom 19 studies, 1531 subjects were included (  n  =813 patients;   n  =718 healthy controls). In the patient group, sample size ranged from 10  to 202  patients with schizophrenia. Four of 19 studies investigated childhood-onset  or adolescent-onset  schizophrenia. The mean age of patients in the whole sample ranged from 13.9 years (childhood schizophrenia study from Rapoport   et al.  ) to 39.4 years.  The percentage of male patients in each study ranged from 37  to 100%  male patients outnumbered female patients overall (  n  =586 males;   n  =227 females). As just one study presented data for male and female patients separately,  it was not possible to directly compare gray matter volume changes between sexes; gender was therefore considered among the potential moderators of the ES (see below). \n\nTwo of 18 studies reported brain volumes only in terms of milliliters at baseline scan and at follow-up (mean and s.d. or s.e.) rather than percentage volume change and, in these cases,  the percentage volume change in brain tissue was computed by the authors as described earlier. The studies included in the meta-analysis were published from 1998 to 2012. \n\nFor the subgroup analysis, studies that investigated a group of patients with first-episode schizophrenia and a group of controls were included. In all, 12 studies were identified as suitable for the longitudinal analysis of brain volume in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. We carefully evaluated the criteria adopted in the studies to define first-episode patients. In most studies, first episode was operationally defined as the first psychiatric hospitalization.  Other authors refer to first contact with psychiatric services or patients receiving treatment for an episode of psychosis for the first time.  Mean duration of illness since the onset of psychotic symptoms (6\u201312 months at baseline scan) was used to define first-episode schizophrenia in a few studies.  We restricted our analysis of first-episode schizophrenia to those patients analyzed within 24 months from illness onset (no chronic cases were included). Thus, in this subgroup analysis, we did not include the studies by Molina   et al.  ,  Keshavan   et al.   and Boonstra   et al.   because the duration of illness at baseline scan was 27, 36 and 40 months, respectively. The pool of studies included in the analyses of first-episode patients consisted of nine studies  and covered the following gray matter volumes: whole brain, frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes and left and right HG. \n\n\n### Results of the main meta-analysis \n  \n compares the change in brain volume over time in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Relative to controls, patients with schizophrenia showed a significantly higher volumetric decrease over time of whole brain gray matter, left STG, left anterior STG, left posterior STG, right posterior STG, left HG and left PT gray matter. None of the other brain regions considered showed significantly different changes between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. \n\nThe Cochran   Q   test showed a significant between-studies heterogeneity in the analysis of the following brain regions: whole brain gray matter, frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobe gray matter, right and left STG, right and left anterior STG, left posterior STG, left HG and left PT gray matter. The potential sources of heterogeneity detected in the analysis of such brain structures have therefore been further considered in meta-regression analyses (detailed below). \n\n lists the   P  -values for the Egger test for publication bias for each brain region. No evidence of possible publication bias for the cerebral structures investigated was found, except for frontal lobe and right and left anterior STG gray matter volume change, with higher ES detected in earlier studies. \n\n shows the estimation of percentage of change (per year) of brain volumes in patients and controls for different gray matter structures. \n\n\n### Results of the meta-analysis in first-episode schizophrenia \n  \nBrain volume change over time for first-episode patients and healthy controls is shown in  . Patients with first-episode schizophrenia showed a significantly larger decrease in volume not only of whole brain gray matter but also of frontal lobe, temporal lobe and parietal lobe gray matter. Moreover, they showed larger decrease in gray matter volume of the left HG. \n\nThe Cochran   Q   test showed a significant between-studies heterogeneity for the following brain regions: whole brain and temporal lobe, and left HG. \n\nNo evidence of possible publication bias was found, with the exception of occipital lobe gray matter (  P  =0.02). \n\n\n### Meta-regression of demographic, clinical, treatment, neuroradiological and study quality variables on ES of differential gray matter volume change over time \n  \nA number of clinical, pharmacological and neuroradiological variables were found to be significant moderators of ES of differences of brain volume changes between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. The summary of findings are presented in  . \n\nVariables found to be significant moderators of ES of differential brain volume changes between patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls are also presented in  . \n\nThe following variables that resulted significantly correlated with ESs (explanation of the correlations presented in   legend). \n\nAs for total brain gray matter volume, the ES of the difference between groups was affected by the moderators \u2018age of onset' (  Z  =3.73,   P  =0.0001), \u2018percentage of patients treated with atypical antipsychotics' (  Z  =2.24,   P  =0.024) and \u2018MRI slice thickness' (  Z  =2.05,   P  =0.040). \n\nThe ES of frontal lobe gray matter resulted to be affected by the moderator \u2018duration of illness at baseline' (  Z  =2.21,   P  =0.027). A similar correlation was also found for occipital lobe gray matter (  Z  =2.45,   P  =0.014). \n\nParietal lobe ES resulted to be affected by the moderator \u2018patients' mean age at baseline scan' (  Z  =2.68,   P  =0.007). \n\nAs for temporal lobe gray matter, significant correlations between the ES and the moderators, \u2018percentage of patients treated with atypical antipsychotics' (  Z  =2.39,   P  =0.016) and \u2018patients' mean age at baseline scan' (  Z  =2.44,   P  =0.014), were demonstrated. \n\nLeft STG ES were affected by the moderators \u2018duration of illness' (  Z  =2.45,   P  =0.013), \u2018MRI slice thickness' (  Z  =2.92,   P  =0.003) and \u2018quality of the study' (  Z  =\u22122.36,   P  =0.018). Right STG ES were affected by the moderators \u2018slice thickness' (  Z  =3.49,   P  =0.0004), \u2018age of onset' (  Z  =2.70,   P  =0.006), \u2018mean age at baseline' (  Z  =1.98,   P  =0.04) and \u2018quality of the study' (  Z  =\u22124.03,   P  =0.0006). As for the left anterior STG, a significant correlation between ES and the variables \u2018percentage of males in the study sample' (  Z  =2.46   P  =0.013), \u2018patients' mean age at baseline scan' (  Z  =3.11,   P  =0.001) and \u2018duration of illness at baseline' (  Z  =2.97,   P  =0.002) were demonstrated. The ES of right anterior STG resulted to be affected by the moderator \u2018patients' mean age at baseline scan' (  Z  =2.67,   P  =0.007) and \u2018age of onset' (  Z  =2.23,   P  =0.025). Left posterior STG ES that resulted correlated with the variable \u2018duration of illness at baseline' (  Z  =2.21,   P  =0.026). \n\nWith respect to left HG, a significant correlation was demonstrated between ES and the moderator \u2018duration of illness at baseline' (  Z  =2.57,   P  =0.009). Such a correlation was also demonstrated for left PT (  Z  =2.82,   P  =0.004). Moreover, for left PT, statistically significant correlations emerged also for the following moderators: \u2018patients' mean age at baseline scan' (  Z  =2.44,   P  =0.014), \u2018age of onset' (  Z  =\u22122.78,   P  =0.0005), \u2018duration of illness at baseline' (  Z  =2.82,   P  =0.004), MRI slice thickness (  Z  =2.44,   P  =0.014) and \u2018quality of the study' (  Z  =2.44,   P  =0.014). \n\nIn first-episode schizophrenia, the meta-regressions, which were restricted to total gray matter ES, that resulted correlated with the variables \u2018patients' mean age at baseline scan' (  Z  =2.10,   P  =0.035) and \u2018MRI slice thickness' (  Z  =2.33,   P  =0.019). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nPatients with schizophrenia, compared with healthy controls, show a significantly higher progressive reduction in cortical gray matter volume over time. A substantial progressive loss of total gray matter volume, with a moderate ES (  g  =\u20130.50), was demonstrated. However, the pattern of gray tissue loss does not affect the brain uniformly but is specific to discrete cortical areas, which appear to be affected by such progression at different stages of the disease. For the first time with a meta-analytic approach, and at variance with other quantitative reviews on the time course of brain abnormalities in schizophrenia,  we demonstrated a selective, rather than generalized, involvement of cortical gray matter in the trajectory of brain tissue loss. \n\nIn particular, we detected a significantly more pronounced decrease of gray matter volume in the STG and STG subregions (HG and PT) in patients with schizophrenia: the magnitudes of the ES for the left STG (  g  =\u22120.80), left HG (  g  =\u22121.05) and left PT (  g  =\u22121.18) were large; on the other hand, several other cortical subregions did not exhibit such a large reduction in volume over time. The role of superior temporal lobe structures in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia was intensely debated in the 1990s, but has not been systematically addressed by later studies. This is a case where traditional ROI methodology may be more informative than more sophisticated techniques that rely on automated computation of surface or whole gray matter volumes, with which the opportunity to detect subtle, localized or deep brain alterations is lost. Changes in STG volume have been related to positive symptom severity, especially of thought disorder (posterior STG)  and hallucinations (anterior and middle STG);  HG volume abnormalities have been correlated to severity of formal thought disorder  and PT alterations to language and thought disorder of schizophrenia.  The higher involvement of these areas in the trajectory of progression of brain abnormalities strengthens the hypothesis of a specific relevance of these brain regions in the pathophysiology of the disorder or, in turn, of the centrality of thought and language disorders in schizophrenia, according to a relevant, still actual, phenomenological literature,  only partly incorporated in the current diagnostic criteria of the disease (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV TR) and International Classification of Disease, 10th revision (ICD-10)). \n\nA significant effect of hemisphere has also been clearly demonstrated in this meta-analysis for volume loss of temporal gray matter. The anterior STG, HG and PT appeared to show excessive tissue loss over time in the left, but not the right hemisphere. This may explain the finding of abnormalities in cerebral asymmetries frequently, but inconsistently reported in previous literature on the brain pathology of schizophrenia.  The progression of cortical volume changes seems to affect especially the left hemisphere: this could justify the finding of abnormal asymmetries reported particularly in chronic, rather than first-episode cases, when this phenomenon may be less detectable. A reduced lateralization of cortical structures has been recently reported also at the onset of schizophrenia, before medical treatment is initiated, most prominent in the inferior frontal gyrus (part of Broca's area) and the STG (part of Wernicke's area).  Moreover, a reduction in normal cerebral asymmetries, particularly in superior temporal structures, has been proposed as a trait marker of schizophrenia by some authors.  According to the existing literature  and our own findings, however, this reduction may be even more relevant over time, after progressive tissue loss affected the two hemispheres differently. Our findings therefore confirm that the left (dominant) hemisphere may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and may also be particularly sensitive to the trajectory of pathological progressive brain changes characterizing this disease. Consistently with this hypothesis, a polymorphism of   NRG1   gene has been found to be involved in determining STG size in schizophrenia, and suggested to have a role in the neurogenetic basis of the language disturbances seen in this disorder.  Analyses of the subsample of studies that selectively investigated first-episode patients gave us the opportunity to make some more specific inferences about the time of occurrence of such progressive loss of cortical gray matter. \n\nIn the case of first-episode patients, larger ESs than those detected in the whole sample for the difference in brain tissue loss between patients and controls were detected for all brain regions considered in the analyses. This strongly supports the hypothesis that progressive tissue loss is especially active in the first phases of the illness. Such an early tissue loss affects diffuse cerebral regions and indicates a process that may lead at a later stage (that is, in chronic samples) to a decrease in whole brain volume.  The latter may be consistent also with the notion of progressive ventricular enlargement acknowledged by most, although not all, studies,  and quantitatively reviewed by Kempton   et al.  ,  who demonstrated a larger than normal increase in the volume of lateral ventricles over time in chronic schizophrenia. Although not directly investigated by our meta-analysis, this could be compatible with the evidence of progressive loss of white matter volume over the disease course,  which may determine, or parallel, cerebral ventricular enlargement. On the other hand, the most divergent trajectory of cortical structural changes between patients with schizophrenia and normal subjects arises during the very first phases of the disease, when there is evidence of accelerated gray matter loss; at a later stage, the decrease in gray matter volume is likely to be similar to what appears to be a physiological correlate of aging. \n\nThe notion of a different trajectory of brain changes over time between patients and controls is also supported by the results of the few original longitudinal studies with three or more MRI measurements for the same cohorts. The largest such study from Andreasen   et al.   showed that reductions in brain tissue volume in patients with first-episode schizophrenia were greatest during the first interscan interval (2 years) when patients had significantly greater reductions than healthy volunteers in nearly all gray matter measures. Conversely, changes in brain volume in patients during the second (3\u20134 years after the second scan) and third (3\u20134 years after the third MRI measurement) interscan intervals did not differ significantly from those found in healthy volunteers. The results of our meta-regression analysis between the ES of the differences in gray matter loss between patients and controls and the duration of illness at first MRI scan confirms this hypothesis; the longer the duration of illness, the lower the difference in volume change over time detected between patients and controls. This may be again somewhat specific to defined brain areas, involving the frontal and occipital lobes, and, only in the left hemisphere, STG, the anterior and posterior portions of STG, HG and PT. \n\nSince the definition we used for first episode, including patients who had the first scan within 24 months from onset, may be somehow misleading because many of such patients could have been exposed to long-term psychotropic drugs, we conducted a supplemental meta-analysis of first-episode cases limited to those patients with a duration of illness no longer than 12 months. In fact, adopting this more conservative approach, the magnitude of the differences between volumetric changes in schizophrenic and control groups became even larger as for the only cortical brain region that could be investigated according to our inclusion criteria (at least three study suitable for analysis), that is, whole brain gray matter (  g  =\u22120.61; confidence interval=\u22120.87 to \u22120.37;   P  <.001). Moreover, our findings relative to left HG in first-episode schizophrenia derived from studies that recruited only patients within their 1st year of illness. \n\nMeta-regression analysis between the ES of the differences in gray matter loss between patients and controls and the age of patients at baseline scan showed lower ES in older patients for temporal and parietal lobes, for STG and its anterior component only in the right hemisphere and for left PT. This indicates that the trajectory of gray matter changes may be affected differently by the disease process and aging, the former being more active in the left hemisphere and the latter involving cerebral gray matter more generally. \n\nOur findings are consistent, and complementary, to those obtained in recent meta-analyses of VBM studies in antipsychotic na\u00efve subjects at high risk of psychosis and first-episode schizophrenia patients, which indicate that gray matter reductions in the anterior cingulated may be a marker of genetic liability to psychosis, while reductions in the STG can be interpreted as markers of first onset schizophrenia. \n\nTaken together, the results of our study provide useful information about the time and site of occurrence of progressive gray matter changes in schizophrenia, substantially refining and shaping the hypothesis of schizophrenia as a general progressive brain disease.  A number of hypotheses, not mutually exclusive, may be advocated to explain the different time course of brain structural changes over the lifespan between patients with schizophrenia and healthy individuals. The existence of a cortical neurodegenerative process acting differently at different stages of the disease, particularly detectable around the onset and the first phases of overt illness, can be proposed. It is also possible to speculate on the existence of a pathological maturational program determining both early (pre- or perinatal) neurodevelopmental anomalies and later development of abnormal brain processes during adolescence and early adulthood, leading to, or paralleling, the onset of the disease. It is also plausible that there is an interaction between the two, that is, that anomalous neurodevelopmental processes may interact with other factors occurring around the onset of psychosis leading to accelerated tissue loss, which adds to the earlier abnormalities, to determine the ultimate brain pathology possibly relevant to the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia. This accelerated tissue loss may be especially active in the first phases of the disease and progressively less evident as the disease stabilizes, and may be counteracted by continuous treatment. Consistent with this possibility, it has been claimed that some of the brain abnormalities found at the onset of psychoses may be at least in part reversible.  Even if the cause of the observed pattern of progressive brain changes during the course of schizophrenia remains largely unclear, it is possible to state that certain brain areas are involved in substantial alteration just around the time of onset and during the early course of the disease. \n\nAnother finding of the present meta-analysis is that the type of antipsychotic treatment may be a significant moderator of the time course of brain abnormalities in schizophrenia. In particular, treatment with atypical antipsychotics seems to reduce or at least, in part, counteract the progressive loss of cortical gray matter tissue in the whole brain, especially in the temporal lobe. Treatment with antipsychotic medications has been considered to be an important potential confounder of the progressive changes in brain volume detected in schizophrenia by other authors.  Our finding is consistent with that of a controlled longitudinal MRI study comparing the effects of an SGA (olanzapine) and an FGA (haloperidol) on gray and white matter volumes in first-episode schizophrenia, reporting substantial progressive (global) gray matter loss over a 1-year period in the patients on haloperidol, but not in those treated with olanzapine.  It has been hypothesized that SGAs may have a neuroprotective effect in schizophrenia, either increasing the expression of neurotrophic factors  or stimulating neurogenesis,  or interacting with and increasing the activity of   N  -methyl-\ud835\udc9f-aspartate glutamate receptors.  Conversely, the excess reduction in cortical gray matter observed in patients treated with FGAs may be attributable to a direct neurotoxic effect secondary to oxidative stress and/or excitotoxic phenomena, which have been well documented in animals treated with haloperidol  or may indicate a hypothetical lower capacity of FGAs to interfere with the natural pathophysiological trajectory of the disease, which may also be reflected in the different impact on cerebral blood flow and metabolism of FGAs versus SGAs.  A recently published MRI longitudinal study  reported progressive brain tissue loss in patients with schizophrenia followed for up to 14 years and related such loss to antipsychotic drug use. However, it seems likely that the results of this uncontrolled study could not distinguish between the highly intercorrelated variables of illness severity and antipsychotic dose taken. In fact, it is now well known that brain abnormalities are present even before the onset of schizophrenia, in the prodromal stage of the disease or in first-episode drug-naive patients  independently of drug treatment, and that these anomalies show progression over time even during the phase of transition to psychosis,  again without or with little potential effect of pharmacotherapy. Alternatively, morphological abnormalities in the brain, and their progression over time, may represent a significant correlate of poor outcome of schizophrenia, for which a larger prescription and use of antipsychotic drugs may be considered an epiphenomenon. Early  and more recent  literature confirm that the most consistent clinical correlate of structural brain abnormalities and their progressive change is poor clinical outcome of the disease. \n\nAge at onset of schizophrenia was a significant moderator of change of whole brain gray matter, of right STG (and its anterior component) and left PT gray matter loss ES. This suggests that the trajectory of cortical gray matter loss is more pronounced in early-onset schizophrenia. That is not surprising given the large literature reporting a different severity of clinical presentation and course of early- versus late-onset schizophrenia.  The ratio of male to female patients included in the studies was not a significant moderator of ES, with the only exception of a more pronounced tissue loss in left anterior STG in female patients, compatible with a higher prevalence of hallucinations and positive versus negative symptoms in female than in male patients.  Slice thickness of MRI scans was a significant moderator of the ES for whole brain and STG gray matter, indicating more evident differences between patients and controls detected in technologically more sophisticated studies. We also calculated a composite index of overall quality of the study, and this was found to be a significant moderator of ES for STG, the higher the study quality, the higher the differences detected between patients and controls, and for PT (left) in the opposite direction. Study quality may therefore affect MRI findings from different brain structures differently, especially in those discrete areas that present difficult or controversial segmentation procedures. \n\nThis study suffers from several limitations. First, common to all meta-analyses, a complete control of the quality of the primary studies, that is, on the possibility that certain biases were present in the original studies, was not possible. For instance, most of the studies considered in the meta-analysis included both schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders patients without presenting separate results for these subgroups; others investigated both drug-naive and previously treated first-episode subjects again without presenting separate data for the subgroups. We tried to address the issue of the quality of primary studies, assigning them a \u2018value' reflecting the degree of rigorousness and reliability of methods and results, and analyzing this as a potential moderator of ESs. The presence of significant results for this moderator indicates that weaknesses of the studies might have a role in the findings of each original study. Second, the choice of performing analyses without correction for multiple comparisons could have generated type I errors in the results. However, the independence of each meta-analysis on different brain structures, each driven by a single hypothesis, and the exploratory nature of meta-regressions, which were performed not to confirm but to elicit new testable hypotheses, justified the choice and the risk to obtain results that could be not confirmed by specifically addressed new research. Third, in general, our analysis was limited to the variables reported in the original studies. This was particularly evident for the description of the pharmacological regimen of patients during the study period, with only a small minority of studies reporting the amount of antipsychotic drugs taken between scans and therefore limiting the possibility to investigate more carefully this variable. In fact, the moderator \u2018percentage of patients using atypical antipsychotics' is a very rough index of actual intake of specific antipsychotic drugs. However, there was no better way to analyze this issue since the studies available did not report either the cumulative dose of different classes of antipsychotics or of specific drugs taken. The correlation of the ES of different cortical gray matter changes and the proportion of patients treated with SGAs versus FGAs may be in any case meaningful. Rather than allowing any conclusive interpretation on the relationship between type of antipsychotic taken and cortical brain changes, such findings may indicate the need for further studies specifically aimed at clarifying the issue. Fourth, the number of published papers eligible for the analysis was small, so that some brain regions potentially implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, such as the prefrontal cortex or cingulate gyrus gray matter, could not be investigated. Fifth, the largely unbalanced sex distribution in the studies did not allow to analyze in a definitive manner the role of gender on brain structural changes and progressive tissue loss in schizophrenia, even if the moderator variable analyzed (percentage of males in the sample) did not resulted significant in explaining the heterogeneity of ESs. Sixth, the course over time of cerebral lateralized structures could be inferred but not directly analyzed, as no study reported laterality indices for individual subjects or group of subjects. Finally, the results of both ES and meta-regressions were not corrected for multiple comparisons, so they may have been vulnerable to type I error. We carefully considered the relative costs of detecting versus failing to detect significant effects and decided to avoid statistical corrections. In fact, each meta-analysis on any specific brain region should be considered a separate analysis for which any statistical correction should be questionable; moreover, also applying a more stringent level of significance (that is, <0.01), all but one ES remained significant. On the other hand, meta-regressions, there were in any case limited   a priori   in number, were intended to be exploratory analyses with the aim to generate, rather than prove, hypotheses, so that correction for multiple comparisons would be too restrictive, particularly for revealing otherwise elusive effects. \n\nIn conclusion, with all the above-mentioned limitations in mind, the picture emerging from this series of meta-analyses could be useful to generate new hypotheses and suggests the need for further studies specifically aimed to test them. A more refined progressive brain pathology hypothesis of schizophrenia is emerging, with meaningful regional and temporal specificity of the pathological brain process. Whether preceded by substantial early brain changes, genetic or environmental in origin, the time around the onset and the first phases of the disease seem crucial for a rapid, progressive, cortical tissue loss that could partly determine the clinical and outcome severity of the disorder. This process is especially active in the left hemisphere and in the superior temporal structures, the same structures that are involved in the mediation of core psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia and/or their severity. The time and type of antipsychotic treatment seem to counteract partially such process, but are not able to arrest it. Future studies should address some specific issues raised by these results, such as the course over time not only of the volume of cortical gray matter but also of other brain components before the onset of schizophrenia compared with well-matched healthy controls, in relation to potential moderators such as specific genetic polymorphisms or the presence or absence of crucial environmental factors. Even short-term longitudinal studies may be informative, since the longer the follow-up the greater the number of potential confounders of the effects analyzed. Further studies will be required to better understand how the progressive brain changes affect the morphological lateralization of the schizophrenic brain, an issue of potentially high heuristic value. The clinical correlates of tissue loss in specific brain areas in the different phases of illness are largely unknown. The hypothesis of schizophrenia as a progressive generalized brain disease is far less established than believed by many authors, and requires further, more specific, straightforward and thoughtful search. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 3565772, "text_md5": "09edd34b7c4a36c0b823b659328aeb17", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 52], "journal": [53, 70], "publication_year": [72, 76], "title": [87, 209], "keywords": [223, 331], "abstract": [344, 2475], "body": [2484, 49769]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 23168990, "doi": "10.1038/tp.2012.116", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3565772", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3565772"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3565772\">3565772</a>", "list_title": "PMC3565772  Progressive loss of cortical gray matter in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis and meta-regression of longitudinal MRI studies"}

In this study, we reviewed the main experimental paradigms and made a cognitive-oriented meta-analysis of fMRI studies of human navigation to underline the importance of the experimental designs and cognitive tasks used to assess navigational skills. We performed a general activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 66 fMRI experiments to identify the neural substrates underpinning general aspects of human navigation. Four individual ALE analyses were performed to identify the neural substrates of different experimental paradigms (i.e., familiar vs. recently learned environments) and different navigational strategies (allocentric vs. egocentric). Results of the general ALE analysis highlighted a wide network of areas with clusters in the occipital, parietal, frontal and temporal lobes, especially in the parahippocampal cortex. Familiar environments seem to be processed by an extended temporal-frontal network, whereas recently learned environments require activation in the parahippocampal cortex and the parietal and occipital lobes. Allocentric strategy is subtended by the same areas as egocentric strategy, but the latter elicits greater activation in the right precuneus, middle occipital lobe and angular gyrus. Our results suggest that different neural correlates are involved in recalling a well-learned or recently acquired environment and that different networks of areas subtend egocentric and allocentric strategies. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11065-014-9247-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn the past 20\u00a0years, an increasing number of studies in the cognitive neuroscience literature have analyzed human ability to navigate and orient in recently learned and familiar environments by investigating the cognitive processes involved in successful navigation. The latter include the ability to retain the spatial layout of an environment, find a shortcut between two locations or create an interconnected network among different paths. \n\nThe data reported in these studies are often contrasting, perhaps because of differences in methods and in the specific cognitive processes investigated in the experimental paradigms. In this light, a methodological review with a meta-analytic approach could be useful to bridge the gap in the literature regarding the neural correlates of human navigation. On one side, a methodological review allows highlighting the main cognitive variables across fMRI studies; on the other side, a meta-analytic approach makes it possible to analyze the role of these variables by integrating data from several studies to identify brain areas that show a consistent response across studies and experimental variables. \n\nThe first step is to identify the main differences in the paradigms used in fMRI studies of human navigation. One of the most obvious differences is familiarity with the environment in which the participants have to navigate. In some studies, participants are presented with environments they have been very familiar with for years (Maguire et al.  ; Nemmi et al.  ). In other studies, they are exposed to the environment just before the experimental test (Berthoz  ) or during the study (Iaria et al.  ). In any case, successful navigation of both humans and animals depends on memories of the environment, that is, the degree of familiarity and the time lapse between the learning phase and recall. Montello ( ) reported that environments which are well known and familiar are more likely to be represented in a survey format (similar to cognitive maps) and that the format of representation, which influences the style of navigation, changes with degree of familiarity. Iaria et al. ( ) showed that learning a virtual environment activates different hippocampal areas than those activated during recall when learning is fully established. Furthermore, studies of other types of memory (i.e., episodic memory) have shown that areas involved in the recall of less familiar items (i.e., items that have been recently learned) are slightly different from those involved in the recall of very familiar items that have already been recalled several times (Henke  ; Carr et al.  ). Thus, it is very likely that the variations in brain activities observed in different studies of spatial navigation are linked to the different degree of familiarity (i.e. very familiar vs. recently learned) participants have with experimental environments. Another main difference between experimental paradigms is the type of environmental representation (egocentric vs. allocentric) elicited by the experimental task. When using egocentric representations, participants locate environmental items by referring to their own position (e.g., the door is on my left, the window is behind me on the right, etc.). Instead, in allocentric representation the position of the item is not linked to that of the participants (e.g., the door is northwest, the window is 5\u00b0 south, etc.). \n\nOnce the main methodological axis in the spatial navigation literature has been identified, the second step (which is central to the current study) is to verify converging and consistent evidence in the current literature by means of a meta-analysis, integrating data from several studies. This will allow assessing the role of the main methodological variables of fMRI studies, overcoming the limitations of the single study approach, such as small sample size, low reliability and logical subtraction, which is sensitive only to differences between conditions. \n\nFirst, we will review the fMRI studies within a theoretical framework that takes into account a) degree of familiarity with the environments and b) types of environmental representations and navigational strategies required by the experimental task. Then, we will carry out a meta-analysis on fMRI studies of human navigation using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) (Eickhoff et al.  ) to verify involvement of the neural network identified in the review and differences related to the previously identified methodological variables. \n\nThe main aims of the meta-analysis were the following: (i) to find converging evidence of a specific and dedicated network for spatial navigation in the human brain, to overcome the discrepancies found in neuroimaging studies of human navigation; (ii) to test the hypothesis that well-learned, familiar environments and recently learned environments are processed by different neural substrates; and (iii) to assess the degree of overlap between the brain networks that mediate the egocentric and allocentric strategies employed in navigation. \n\n\n## Paradigm: Navigating in Recently Learned and Familiar Environments \n  \nNeuroimaging studies of human navigation can be roughly divided into studies that focus on recently learned environments, that is, environments learned for experimental purposes (e.g. a university campus or a virtual environment) (Janzen and van Turennout  ; Janzen and Weststeijn  ; Janzen and Jansen  ; Iaria et al.  ,  ,  ; Schinazi and Epstein  ) and studies that require participants to perform experimental tasks in familiar environments (Rosenbaum et al.  ,  ; Hirshhorn et al.  ; Spiers and Maguire  ; Ino et al.  ). In the first type of paradigm (hereafter called the RL paradigm), the aim is to understand the neural basis of coding, storing and use of navigational knowledge. A good example of the RL paradigm is Iaria and colleagues\u2019 study using the Cognitive Map Test (Iaria et al.  ). These authors created a virtual environment that permitted good control over stimulation and allowed studying both learning and retrieval. The environment consisted of several buildings of different sizes and shapes and six clearly identifiable landmarks. The participants moved in the virtual environment by using a three-button keypad; each button corresponded to a different direction of movement. Latini-Corazzini et al. ( ) also used an RL environmental paradigm and developed a virtual reality task in which participants navigated to acquire the knowledge necessary to carry out the subsequent spatial tasks. In this case, the main environment was a small virtual town with a regular grid of streets and 21 buildings, most of which had no distinctive features. Nine buildings had specific signs (hotel, bank, etc.). In the practice phase participants could freely explore the town, but in the encoding phase they could only move along a defined route. Using an RL paradigm, Baumann et al. ( ) created a virtual \u201carena\u201d consisting of an infinite plain. The arena contained four objects: three cylinders of different colors (landmarks) and one yellow pyramid (target). The pyramid had a virtual \u2018light beacon\u2019, which projected vertically from the apex and signaled the pyramid\u2019s position when it was occluded by the landmarks. During the encoding phase, each participant had to navigate toward the target and remember its spatial position with respect to the three landmarks. \n\nAt variance with the RL paradigm, in some studies the environments used in the experimental tasks are already familiar to participants. In these studies (hereafter called the familiar (F) paradigm), the aim is to explore the recall and use of navigational knowledge. Spiers and Maguire\u2019s ( ) \u201ctaxi-driver-task\u201d is a very good example of an F paradigm. It presents novel tasks to participants who have gained thorough knowledge of the experimental environment over a long period of time. These authors used a virtual reproduction of London to assess the previously acquired spatial knowledge of taxi drivers, who had gotten their license by demonstrating good knowledge of the city. Rosenbaum and colleagues (Rosenbaum et al.  ,  ; Hirshhorn et al.  ) carried out two studies involving mental navigation in the city of Toronto. Nemmi et al. ( ) asked participants who had lived in Rome for at least 5\u00a0years and had demonstrated good familiarity with the city centre to indicate whether three landmarks were shown in correct order along a route. Ino et al. ( ) tested participants who were very familiar with Kyoto City and during the fMRI asked them to mentally navigate from one place (named by the experimenter) to another. \n\nIt is noteworthy that in the only study which directly contrasted remote and recent learning of navigational information (Hirshhorn et al.  ) the hippocampal formation was activated only for recently acquired spatial knowledge and the extra-hippocampal structures (i.e. parahippocampal cortex, lingual gyrus and precuneus) were engaged in the recall of remote spatial knowledge. \n\nThe debate over the role of increasing familiarity in both behavioral and neuroimaging data is related to the debate over the role of the hippocampus in declarative episodic memory and the contrasting findings in patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL) amnesia (Milner  ; Bohbot and Corkin  ). As in other forms of declarative memory, spatial memory seems to be compromised in patients with MTL lesions, but not all memories seem impaired to the same extent. Although it is widely recognized that patients with hippocampal and MTL damage cannot learn to navigate in a novel environment, there is evidence that they are usually able to navigate in environments learned before the damage (Habib and Sirigu  ; Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ). This mirrors the well-known dissociation between new and old episodic memory in amnesic patients (Milner  ), which is compatible with different longstanding theories about the hippocampal role: the declarative theory (Tulving  ), the Standard model of memory consolidation (Squire and Alvarez  ) and the multiple trace theory (Moscovitch et al.  ; Moscovitch et al.  .). All of these models propose that some memories might survive hippocampal damage but they differ in the mechanism supposed to explain this survival. The declarative theory hypothesizes that the hippocampus is necessary only in the formation of episodic and spatial memories and that its role is time-limited because it is linked to the fixation of memories that will be stored in neo-cortical areas. The Standard model of memory consolidation proposed a gradual reorganization within long-term memory storage so that, as time passes after learning, the importance of the hippocampal formation gradually diminishes accordingly to the increasing of memory consolidation until a permanent memory trace develops which is independent from this region. By contrast, the multiple trace theory hypothesizes that a new trace is formed in the hippocampus every time a certain memory is recollected, so that older memories become more resistant to hippocampal damage or become semantic and independent from the hippocampus. According to the authors who support these theories, spatial memory and its failure following hippocampal damage is a valid model for studying the more general system of episodic memory. \n\nThe claim that old memories of familiar environments are retained in MTL-damaged patients who show impaired recall of recently acquired environments and are unable to learn totally new ones has been challenged (Nadel and Moscovitch  ) and some studies have shown that hippocampal activity is not limited to the recall of recently learned environments (Niki and Luo  ). Therefore, another aspect that remains controversial is the role of the hippocampus in remembering very familiar environments or spatial memories acquired in the distant past and often recollected. A study brining evidences in favor of the persisting of highly familiar spatial representation in spite of hippocampal damage is the one by Maguire et al. ( ), who showed that a taxi driver after extensive bilateral hippocampal damage retained the ability to navigate in a virtual reconstruction of the city of London. Since he was able to navigate by means of the main or principal routes but not using minor routes, the author concluded that a \u201csketch map\u201d of an environment (i.e. a semantic type of spatial memory, opposed to an episodic one) could be remembered without hippocampal involvement (Maguire et al.  ). \n\nAnyway the relationship between hippocampus and familiarity of the spatial representations has been somewhat neglected in the functional literature and only a few studies have directly compared old and recent spatial memories (Niki and Luo  ; Hirshhorn et al.  ; Maguire et al.  ) and have reported contrasting evidence. Starting from the above-described theoretical framework, a meta-analytic approach, assessing the consistence of the neural response across studies and experimental variables would clarify the role of the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. \n\n\n## Spatial Strategies: Egocentric and Allocentric Representations \n  \nNeuroimaging studies on spatial navigation can also be separated according to the type of representation participants have to retrieve to perform the task. As stated above, we chose to focus on egocentric (ego) and allocentric (allo) spatial representations. \n\nNeuroimaging studies focusing on egocentric navigation can be divided into those assessing \u201coffline\u201d spatial egocentric memories and those assessing \u201conline\u201d egocentric-based navigation in real or virtual environments (Wolbers and Hegarty  ). The first type of task requires participants to judge the order of two landmarks along a street (Rosenbaum et al.  ), to recognize or recall landmark appearance (Janzen et al.  ) or to judge whether a certain landmark was or was not along a certain route (Nemmi et al.  ; Schinazi and Epstein  ). The second type of task includes those requiring navigation along habitual routes in real familiar environments by means of mental imagery (Ino et al.  ) or following trails or arrows along the route (i.e., so-called \u201croute following\u201d; Hartley et al.  ). \n\nBy contrast, tasks assessing allocentric-based navigation are usually carried out in virtual environments in which participants have to navigate from a starting point to a goal in a condition that does not allow following the usual route because, for example, it is blocked (Iaria et al.  ; Rosenbaum et al.  ; Spiers and Maguire  ). Although this hypothesis has been questioned (Maguire et al.  ), it is believed that the presence of a blocked route forces participants to access the cognitive map of the environment to \u201cfind\u201d a novel path (Iaria et al.  ,  ). Another way to force participants to use an allocentric representation is to ask them to \u201cfind\u201d a shortcut between two locations so they will not repeat the route they have learned (Rosenbaum et al.  ; Hirshhorn et al.  ). \n\nThe above mentioned Cognitive Map Test (Iaria et al.  ) is a paradigmatic allocentric task. It contains several crossroads and represents a city in which all buildings, except six landmarks, have the same texture. According to the authors, this task taps on the formation and use of a cognitive map, because participants are required to navigate from one landmark to another using the shortest path. Thus, to plan a novel path they have to recall a cognitive map. Iaria et al. ( ) found clear activation of the hippocampal formation: anterior regions were more active when participants were acquiring the allocentric representation of the virtual city and posterior regions were more active when they used the learned representation. \n\nNovel learning of a new environment is not necessarily related to allocentric encoding. According to Montello ( ), the type of encoding and the specific representation recalled depend on the task requirements. Latini-Corazzini et al. ( ) presented a virtual environment similar to the one used by Iaria et al. ( ). After the learning phase, they asked participants to perform a \u201croute\u201d task and a \u201csurvey\u201d task. In the route task, participants were required to follow a route and indicate which direction the path took at various crossing points. In the survey task, they had to indicate the direction in which a certain landmark (not immediately visible) was located with respect to a certain point on the route. To accomplish the first task, participants had to recall an egocentric representation of the route based on the direction of the path; to correctly perform the second task, they had to recall a survey representation of the environment by storing the geometrical configuration of each landmark. \n\nTo differentiate between egocentric and allocentric representations of the environment, Hartley et al. ( ) presented participants with two environments and asked them to learn one environment by following arrows that were visible along a path (egocentric task) and to learn the other one by freely exploring it (allocentric task). During the recall phase, participants accessed an egocentric representation in the first environment and an allocentric (presumably survey) representation in the second environment. \n\nMaguire and colleagues (Maguire et al.  ; Spiers and Maguire  ) focused on tasks that required accessing the allocentric representation of known environments in their \u201ctaxi driver task\u201d. In this task, participants had to take a passenger to a specific location, usually by avoiding some streets or having to change destination in the middle of the path. Being forced to change the habitual route should force participants to use a survey representation of the environment rather than an egocentric representation of habitual routes. \n\nEgocentric and allocentric knowledge can also be tested by so-called mental navigation. In mental navigation tasks, participants have to use visual mental imagery. For example, to test both egocentric and allocentric representations Rosenbaum et al. ( ,  ) and Hirshhorn et al. ( ) asked participants to mentally navigate in a very familiar environment. In tasks tapping egocentric representations, participants have to judge the correctness of a sequence of landmarks along a route to determine which of two landmarks is closest to them or mentally navigate a familiar route while naming the streets encountered along the path. In tasks tapping allocentric representations, participants have to judge which of two landmarks is closest to a third landmark specified in the instructions or to mentally navigate along blocked routes naming all the streets crossed by the path. \n\nFrom a neural point of view, many studies have shown that egocentric navigation is subserved by an ensemble of areas related to landmark knowledge (i.e., parahippocampal place area, Epstein and Ward  ), egocentric spatial representation in the parietal cortex (i.e., precuneus and cuneus, inferior parietal lobe) and heading vectors possibly coded by head-direction cells in the retrosplenial cortex. Instead, allocentric navigation seems mainly related to the hippocampal cortex (Tolman  ; O\u2019Keefe and Nadel  ; Maguire et al.  ) and, more specifically, to a network of areas containing place cells (hippocampus) and grid cells (entorhinal cortex). Additional hypothetical cells, namely boundary vector cells and head-direction cells, which should be located in the retrosplenial complex, have been included in models of human navigation, such as in the BBB model (Byrne and Becker  ). It is believed that these structures, and the cell populations within them, interact to update the participant\u2019s current position in space by calculating the heading vector towards the navigational goal and planning the shortest or most feasible route to reach the goal (Byrne and Becker  ). Head-direction cells were found in the cortex of rodents (Taube et al.  ) and areas coding for head direction have been described in parietal lobe in humans in some papers (see for example, Schindler and Bartels  ). However, a clear localization of neural correlates of head direction cells in humans as well as the understanding of their role in human navigation are still matter of debate, also due to the fact that the impossibility to move the heads during fMRI scan significantly reduces the possibility to test the head-direction system. \n\nNeuroimaging studies have repeatedly shown activations in the hippocampal formation, parietal cortex and retrosplenial regions during tasks involving both egocentric (Wolber et al.  ; Latini-Corazzini et al.  ; Galati et al.  ) and allocentric (Latini-Corazzini et al.  ; Iaria et al.  ) features. While these results suggest that all of these areas are involved in navigation, their specific roles have not yet been identified. In this light, a meta-analytic approach, within the theoretical framework above described, could be useful to identify brain areas that show a consistent response across different studies and experimental settings. Indeed, the differences in cerebral activations we found in the studies cited in the present review of literature could derive from differences in paradigms and tasks used. It is important to note that in the context of fMRI, an experimental task is a way to elicit and to observe a particular cognitive process and that different experimental tasks, coupled with a well-studied control task, can be used to observe the same cognitive process. A great variance in localization and extension of the clusters of cerebral activation found in studies focusing on the same cognitive process (i.e. egocentric or allocentric navigation) or on the same type of spatial representation (i.e. egocentric or allocentric spatial representation), despite the difference in the task used, is certainly surprising and need a deeper analysis. A meta-analysis of fMRI studies, going beyond the limitations of a single study approach, could be a way to fill this gap. \n\n\n## Meta-Analysis \n  \n### Inclusion Criteria for Papers \n  \nThe database search on PubMed was performed using the following string: \u201cfmri AND (navigation OR egocentric OR allocentric OR map) NOT gene NOT genetic NOT DNA NOT heart NOT patients NOT cellular NOT social NOT psychopathy\u201d. A total of 42 studies were found. \n\nOur a-priori inclusion criteria for papers were: 1) Inclusion of whole-brain analysis performed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); thus, we excluded positron emission tomography (PET) studies, electrophysiology studies and papers that reported only results from ROI analysis. 2) Provision of coordinates of activation foci, either in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach reference space. 3) All participants in the studies had to be young and healthy. Studies that included healthy elderly adults were excluded to avoid the effects of aging on navigation. 4) All neuroimaging studies had to include a visuo-perceptual control condition to exclude all activations that were not directly connected to navigation. 5) The experimental tasks required participants to recall a learned environment. They had to make a decision about the pathway learned before or to reach a position in the space by pressing keys or using a joystick. The space was either a virtual reality or a real environment and the task required either allocentric or egocentric strategies. Studies that did not focus on spatial navigation were excluded from the meta-analysis. 6) Only group studies were included. 7) There could be no pharmacological manipulation. \n\nUsing these criteria, we selected 24 studies. Meta-analysis was carried out on 66 neuroimaging experiments (described in the 24 published studies) using the \u201cactivation likelihood estimation\u201d (ALE) analysis. A total of 1023 participants participated in these trials. Studies are summarized in Tables\u00a0  and  .   \nFamiliar and recently learned environment \n  \nExperimental paradigm used in each study \n\nReferences to studies \n\nNumber of subjects included in each study \n\nTotal number of experiments in each paper \n    \nAllocentric and egocentric studies \n  \nNavigational strategies required in reported studies \n\nReferences to studies \n\nNumber of subjects included in each study \n\nTotal number of experiments in each paper \n  \n\n\n### Activation Likelihood Estimation \n  \nActivation likehood estimation (ALE) analyzes the probability that a voxel will contain at least one of the activation foci; it is calculated at each voxel and results in a thresholded ALE map. In other words, ALE assesses the overlap between foci by modelling the probability distributions centered at the coordinates of each one (Eickhoff et al.  ). \n\nA general ALE meta-analysis was performed on the foci derived from the selected studies on navigation (Tables\u00a0  and  ). The coordinates of the foci were taken from original papers. A total of 782 foci were reported in 66 experiments including 1023 participants. \n\nWe also performed four separate ALE analyses on four categories of studies in relation to the type of familiarity paradigm (recently learned vs. familiar environment) and spatial strategies (egocentric vs. allocentric strategies) used in the experiment. \n\nRegarding the categorization of studies according to degree of familiarity, we separated experiments according to whether the environment used in the study was unknown to the participants before they were recruited for the study (recently learned environment paradigm, RL) or was already known before they were recruited (familiar environment paradigm, F), for example, their home town (Maguire et al.  ; Nemmi et al.  ), college campus (Epstein and Ward  ) or a specific district (Hirshhorn et al.  ). We categorized 40 experiments as RL environments and 26 as F environments. \n\nRegarding spatial strategies, the allocentric strategy category included studies that required participants to access a cognitive map of the environment or tasks that forced them to rely on a survey representation of the environment (e.g., to find a shortcut in a blocked-route task). In the egocentric strategy category, we included studies in which participants had to access route knowledge of the environment and in which tasks tapped offline egocentric knowledge of an environment, by means of a landmark-based or a route-following strategy (e.g., participants had to judge the relative distance between landmarks and their own position, Rosenbaum et al.  ). As the authors never stated whether the tasks were egocentric (ego) or allocentric (allo), two experimenters (F.N. and M.B.) independently classified the studies. They classified all but one study (in Xu et al.  ) in the same category. The data from this study were included in the general analysis and in the individual ALE analysis of the paradigm (RL vs. F environment) but not in the analysis of the neural substrate of navigational strategies. A total of 30 experiments were defined as allocentric and 34 as egocentric (see Tables\u00a0  and   for more details). \n\nAfter carrying out separate ALE analyses on the categories of studies [  paradigm   (recently learned vs. familiar environment) and   spatial strategies   (egocentric vs. allocentric strategies)], we performed two contrast analyses to directly compare the effects of the paradigms [(F > RL) and (RL > F)] and strategies [(allo > ego) and (ego > allo)]. These contrast analyses allowed highlighting voxels whose signal was greater in the first than the second condition. We also carried out a conjunction analysis of   paradigms   [(RL)^(F)] and   strategies   [(allo)^(ego)] to identify voxels that subtended both paradigm and strategy conditions. \n\nThe ALE meta-analysis was performed using GingerALE 2.1.1 (brainmap.org) with MNI coordinates (Talairach coordinates were automatically converted into MNI coordinates by GingerALE.). According to Eickhoff et al.\u2019s ( ) modified procedure, the ALE values of each voxel in the brain were computed and a test was performed to determine the null distribution of the ALE statistic of each voxel. The FWHM value was automatically computed, because this parameter is empirically determined (Eickhoff et al.  ). The thresholded ALE map was computed using p values from the previous step and a False Discovery Rate (FDR) at the 0.05 level of significance (Tom Nichol\u2019s FDR algorithm). Moreover, a minimum cluster size of 200\u00a0mm  was chosen. A cluster analysis was performed on the thresholded map. The ALE results were registered on an MNI-normalized template (brainmap.org) using Mango ( ). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### General Meta-Analysis \n  \nIn the general ALE analysis, we found 25 clusters in both the right and left hemispheres (Fig.\u00a0 ) (Detailed information about cluster are reported in supplementary materials, table\u00a0 ). Some of these clusters extended from the right to the left hemisphere and vice versa (e.g. clusters 2, 5 and 11). Others were localized in one of the two hemispheres (clusters 1, 3, 4, 14 and 17). In the right hemisphere, cluster 1 extended from the parahippocampal gyrus to the posterior cingulate cortex and the anterior cerebellum. In the left hemisphere, cluster 3 extended from the parahippocampal gyrus to the anterior cerebellum. An extensive area of ALE peak was found in the left and right precuneus (clusters 4, 5, 17, 25); in the right hemisphere, the precuneus was strongly related to the ALE peaks in the superior and middle occipital gyrus (cluster 4), and in the left hemisphere, to the left superior parietal lobe and the right precuneus (cluster 5). We also found clusters in frontal areas, specifically, the medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and precentral gyrus (clusters 6, 7, 10, 15, 16, 18). The superior parietal lobe showed ALE peaks together with the inferior parietal lobe (cluster 14) (ALE peaks were found in the superior parietal lobe and the inferior parietal lobe (cluster 14)) in the left hemisphere, and the supramarginal gyrus was active on the right side (cluster 23). Clusters in the occipital cortex extended from the lingual gyrus to the posterior cingulate cortex on the left (cluster 2). We found a cluster that included the middle occipital gyrus and the superior occipital gyrus (cluster 4) in the right hemisphere, but only the middle occipital gyrus in the left hemisphere (clusters 8 and 21). Finally, another cluster in the left hemisphere included the cuneus and the precuneus (cluster 17). We also found a cluster in the right caudate nucleus (cluster 20).   \n a   Results of general ALE meta-analysis: a widespread network of areas seems to subtend the human ability to orient navigation. This network includes the medial temporal lobe, parietal and occipital areas, as well as the cerebellum and frontal lobe.   b   Areas showing activation in both egocentric and allocentric spatial strategies span from the occipital to the frontal lobe, as revealed by conjunction analysis egocentric [AND] allocentric strategies.   c   Areas showing activation for both familiar and recently learned environments, as revealed by conjunction analysis F [AND] RL environments \n  \n\nResults of this general ALE analysis, which showed involvement of the parahippocampal cortex, precuneus and lingual gyrus (Rosenbaum et al.  ; Wegman and Janzen  ; Schinazi and Epstein  ; Epstein  ), are in complete agreement with the literature on navigational processes and their neural correlates. We also found consistent and extended clusters in the parietal cortex and frontal areas, which highlights the importance of these structures in navigation. \n\n\n### Paradigm \n  \n#### Familiar Environment \n  \nIn the ALE analysis of the F environment studies, the environment, used as stimulus, was learned through natural exploration (e.g., during daily life activities) and not for experimental purposes. This type of learning also implies that the environmental knowledge used for the experiment was acquired a long time before the study and with no restrictions concerning learning time and modalities (i.e., verbal instructions, free exploration, use of paper maps and/or combinations of modalities). We found a large cluster extending from the right parahippocampal formation to the right posterior cingulate cortex. Activations of both of these structures were also present in the left hemisphere. An occipital cluster extending from the superior to the middle gyrus was active in the right hemisphere. Other clusters in the right hemisphere included the superior temporal gyrus, cingulate gyrus, precuneus, middle frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex. In the left hemisphere, we found foci in the middle and inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, superior occipital gyrus and inferior parietal lobule (see table\u00a0  in supplementary materials for more details). \n\n\n#### Recently Learned Environments \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis of RL environment studies, that is, of studies involving real or virtual environments learned ad hoc for research purposes shown principal clusters in the parahippocampal formation in the right hemisphere, the precuneus bilaterally and the left superior parietal lobule. In the left hemisphere, a cluster was found in the parahippocampal formation and the hippocampus. This is relevant to the animated debate over the role of the hippocampus in navigation. Presumably, the hippocampus is mainly related to acquisition and/or recall of a recently learned space, created ad hoc for the study, and less to a spatial task requiring access to long-term knowledge of familiar, naturally acquired environments. \n\nWe found a cluster in the superior parietal lobule bilaterally and the inferior parietal lobule of the left hemisphere. Foci were also found in the precuneus bilaterally and the left cuneus. The middle occipital gyrus was bilaterally activated, whereas the superior occipital gyrus was activated only in the left hemisphere and the lingual gyrus only in the right hemisphere. In the left hemisphere, we also found foci in the posterior cingulate cortex. The inferior frontal gyri were bilaterally activated, whereas the superior frontal and middle frontal gyri were activated in the right hemisphere and the medial frontal gyrus in the left hemisphere (see table\u00a0  in supplementary materials for more details). \n\n\n#### Contrast Analysis \n  \n##### Familiar vs. Recently Learned Environment \n  \nResults of the T contrast [F > RL] showed clusters of voxels that were more activated by a familiar environment in both left and right hemispheres (Fig.\u00a0 ). We found a cluster in the middle temporal gyrus on the right and foci in the posterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus on the left.   \n a   Areas showing higher activation for familiar environments than recently learned ones, as revealed in the contrast between F vs. RL environments. This network of areas includes a cluster in the middle temporal gyrus in the right and posterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus of the left hemisphere.   b   Areas showing higher activation of RL than F environments, as revealed by the contrast between RL vs. F environments. This network includes the right parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, insula and inferior parietal lobule, left cuneus, precuneus and lingual gyrus \n  \n\nThese results suggest the existence of a specific network of cerebral areas and specific cognitive processes for well-learned familiar environments (Hirshhorn et al.  ). \n\n\n##### Recently Learned vs. Familiar Environment \n  \nThe opposite T contrast [RL > F] showed clusters of voxels that were more activated by RL (Fig.\u00a0 ). We found clusters bilaterally distributed, including the precuneus and cuneus in the left hemisphere and the precuneus, insula, inferior parietal lobule and parahippocampal gyrus in the right hemisphere. \n\n\n\n#### Conjunction Analysis \n  \nConjunction analysis [RL ^ F] showed that the two types of paradigms partially share a neural network consisting of the fusiform, lingual and middle occipital gyri bilaterally and the calcarine cortex and middle frontal gyrus in the left hemisphere (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n### Spatial Strategies \n  \n#### Allocentric \n  \nThe ALE meta-analysis performed on studies that used tasks which rely on allocentric strategies showed clusters (see table\u00a0  in supplementary materials for more details) mainly localized in the parahippocampal gyrus in both right and left hemispheres. Furthermore, bilateral foci were found in the precuneus and lingual gyrus as well as the middle temporal and middle occipital gyri in the right hemisphere and the superior temporal gyrus in the left hemisphere. Other bilateral clusters were found in the frontal cortex. \n\n\n#### Egocentric \n  \nIn the right hemisphere, results of the ALE meta-analysis of studies whose tasks relied on egocentric strategies (see table\u00a0  in supplementary materials for more details) showed the presence of a cluster involving the parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum and posterior cingulate cortex, and a cluster that extended from the parahippocampal gyrus to the amygdala. Clusters were also found in the parahippocampal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex of the left hemisphere, the precuneus in both hemispheres and the superior and middle occipital gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus of the right hemisphere. In the left hemisphere, we found foci in the middle frontal gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, cuneus and precuneus, medial frontal gyrus, lingual gyrus, superior parietal lobule and inferior occipital gyrus. Egocentric strategies also seemed related to activation in the right caudate nucleus, a structure shown to be related to egocentric navigational tasks (Latini-Corazzini et al.  ), as well as to a cluster in the superior parietal lobule, which is strongly related to egocentric strategies (Latini-Corazzini et al.  ; Shelton and Gabrieli  ). \n\nOur finding of involvement of the amygdala as well as the parahippocampal formation in the right hemisphere seems very interesting and somewhat unexpected. \n\nOnce again, results highlighted the role of the parahippocampal formation bilaterally, the lingual gyrus and the parietal lobe (i.e. the precuneus). \n\nResults of contrast analysis showed differences between the two strategies. \n\n\n#### Contrast Analysis \n  \n##### Allocentric vs. Egocentric \n  \nNo suprathreshold clusters were revealed by T contrast [allo > ego], suggesting that the neural areas involved in the two types of navigational strategies partially overlap. This is at odds with results of previous studies that directly compared egocentric and allocentric representations (Galati et al.  ; Committeri et al.  ) but confirms what already partially emerged in studies that directly compared survey and route encoding of spatial information (Shelton and Gabrieli  ). \n\n\n##### Egocentric vs. Allocentric \n  \nAt variance with the previous analysis, T contrast [ego > allo] strategies showed an extended cluster that included the superior occipital gyrus, angular gyrus and precuneus in the right hemisphere (Fig.\u00a0 ).   \nAreas showing higher activation for egocentric than allocentric strategies, as revealed by the contrast between ego vs. allo strategies. A parieto-occipital network that includes the right superior occipital gyrus, angular gyrus and precuneus subtends egocentric representation of space \n  \n\n\n\n#### Conjunction Analysis \n  \nConjunction analysis [allo ^ ego] showed that the two spatial representations share a common network including the fusiform gyrus, insula, lingual gyrus, precuneus, cuneus, and superior frontal lobe bilaterally. Moreover, there was an overlap in the right middle occipital gyrus, left precentral gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus (Fig.\u00a0 ). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis ALE meta-analysis clarified some important issues. First, our finding of converging evidence of a specific and dedicated network for spatial navigation in the human brain (Fig.\u00a0 ) explains some of the discrepancies in neuroimaging studies and corroborates models of human navigation (Byrne and Becker  ; Kravitz et al.  ; Chrastil  ). Second, going beyond the limitations of the single study approach, our results strongly support the hypothesis that there are different neural substrates for navigating in a well-learned, familiar environment and a recently learned environment. Finally, this analysis helps clarify the extent of the overlap between the brain networks of the egocentric and allocentric strategies employed in navigation (see table\u00a0  in supplementary materials for more details).   \n a   Diagram shows the proposed network of human spatial navigation, as revealed by contrast analysis of paradigms (F vs. RL and RL vs. F).   Green rectangle   shows the subset of areas of navigation across F environments (  MFG   middle frontal gyrus,   MTG   middle temporal gyrus,   PCC   posterior cingulate cortex).   Blue triangle   shows the subset of areas involved in processing RL environments (  IPL   inferior parietal lobule,   pCU   precuneus,   CU   cuneus,   LG   lingual gyrus, PHG parahippocampal gyrus).   b   Diagram shows the proposed network of human spatial navigation, as revealed by contrast analysis of strategies (ego vs. allo).   Red circle   shows the subset of areas of egocentric representation of space (  SOG   superior occipital gyrus,   AG   angular gyrus,   pCU   precuneus) \n  \n\nThe results of the   general ALE meta-analysis   emphasize the role of the parahippocampal gyrus and retrosplenial cortex in navigation. Previously, both of these areas were often associated with navigational processes (Epstein  ; Vann et al.  ) and were hypothesized to play separate and complementary roles in human navigation (Epstein et al.  ; Iaria et al.  ), particularly in the retrieval and localization of visual scenes (Epstein  ; Hirshhorn et al.  ). Our findings also confirm involvement of the parietal lobes (Sack  ) in human navigation as well as the middle occipital gyri bilaterally (Epstein et al.  ; Rosenbaum et al.  ) and the caudate nucleus. The importance of the frontal areas in human navigation was confirmed by bilateral activations in the middle frontal gyri, as evidenced by the general ALE. As most studies included in the meta-analysis (Rosenbaum et al.  ; Spiers and Maguire  ; Ekstrom and Bookheimer  ) required that participants \u201cfind a way\u201d to perform a navigational problem-solving task, we suggest that the frontal areas may have a significant role in planning navigation, especially when detours are required. As few studies have investigated this point, it is still unclear whether navigational planning and problem solving differ from other types of planning and problem solving from cognitive and neural perspectives. We also observed cerebellar activations, which need to be further investigated. \n\n### Paradigms: Recently Learned and Familiar Environments \n  \nThe contrast between studies using paradigms of familiar environments and recently learned environments resulted in significant differences in both directions. A fronto-temporal-parietal network (including the middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal gyrus) seems to be involved in processing F environments (familiar vs. recently learned environments, Fig.\u00a0 ), whereas activations of the parahippocampal formation, lingual gyrus and fusiform regions are evidenced by RL environment paradigms (recently learned vs. familiar environments, Fig.\u00a0 ). Hirshhorn et al. ( ) observed that degree of familiarity affects the networks involved in navigational tasks. This is also consistent with findings reported in the neuropsychological literature that lesions in the parahippocampal cortex cause anterograde disorientation (i.e., the inability to learn novel routes and create representations of novel environments) but do not affect the ability to orient and navigate in familiar environments, thus sparing spatial knowledge acquired before the lesion (Habib and Sirigu  ; Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ). This result is also consistent with the Standard model of memory consolidation (Squire and Alvarez  ), which posited a time-limited role of the hippocampus for declarative memories. \n\nHowever, we cannot exclude that the possible role of the hippocampal formation in recalling a recently learned environment is consistent with its proposed role in novelty detection and orienting reactions (Vinogradova  ; Kumaran and Maguire  ,  ,  ). Indeed, according to the multiple trace theory recently acquired environments (at variance with familiar environments) may require further consolidation of memory traces by means of hippocampal activations. Also, as the RL environments are not yet completely consolidated, they may still make use of the hippocampus as a comparator, similar to novel environments when they are being acquired for the first time. \n\nAs to familiar environment paradigms, lesions in the posterior cingulate cortex, which is part of the fronto-temporo-parietal network identified in familiar environment paradigms, result in deficits in orienting and navigating in environments that were familiar before the lesion (Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ). Areas involved in the network that processes familiar environments are also strongly related to egocentric spatial representations (Galati et al.  ) and the translation of representations from allocentric to egocentric formats and vice versa (Byrne and Becker  ). Thus, lesions in these areas may affect the recall of knowledge about familiar environments and prevent its transformation from an allocentric format stored in long-term memory (Montello  ) to an egocentric format used for driving actual navigation (Byrne and Becker  ). \n\nIn conclusion, these results suggest that recently learned and familiar environments are processed by recruiting partially different networks. The first network includes the parahippocampal, fusiform and lingual gyri and is involved in processing memories relative to recently learned environments. The second network includes the middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal gyrus and is involved in recalling familiar environments. \n\n\n### Spatial Strategies: Allocentric and Egocentric Representations \n  \nThe ALE analysis of navigational strategies showed that different and only partially overlapping systems are involved in processing allocentric and egocentric strategies. Conjunction analysis between allocentric and egocentric strategies demonstrated that they share a common network of areas (i.e., fusiform gyrus, insula, lingual gyrus, precuneus, cuneus, superior frontal lobe bilaterally, right middle occipital gyrus, left precentral gyrus and middle frontal gyrus). \n\nInterestingly, the individual ALE on allocentric strategies revealed a cluster in the left superior temporal gyrus. The role of this structure in allocentric strategies is consistent with the hypothesis that it contributes to the formation and use of allocentric representations through the processing of categorical spatial relations (van Asselen et al.  ). In any case, the contrast between allocentric and egocentric studies failed to show any suprathreshold cluster, demonstrating that allocentric encoding recruits a subset of areas also by egocentric encoding, in agreement with Shelton and Gabrieli ( ). \n\nRegarding egocentric strategies, the ALE analysis of egocentric vs. allocentric strategies (Fig.\u00a0 ) showed activation in the right precuneus and angular gyrus. This finding confirms the existence of a dedicated network for the egocentric representation of space in the right hemisphere, including areas in the parietal cortex (probably related to spatial representation) and the retrosplenial cortex (possibly coding heading vectors by means of head direction cells). \n\nInterestingly, patients with right brain damage often have a deficit in spatial navigation and wayfinding (Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ) and lesions of the right precuneus and angular gyrus lead to egocentric disorientation (Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ). Several studies also suggest that the retrosplenial cortex is involved in egocentric spatial navigation and that its lesioning may lead to a condition called Heading Disorientation (Aguirre and D\u2019Esposito  ; Takahashi et al.  ) or Retrosplenial Amnesia (Rudge and Warrington  ). This network is probably also involved in translating allocentric representations of space into egocentric ones and vice versa (Byrne and Becker  ). \n\nSome caution is required in interpreting the results of comparison between egocentric and allocentric strategies. First of all, in discussing the differences between allocentric and egocentric strategies, it has to be taken into account that fMRI studies of egocentric navigation are intrinsically limited by the nature of the neuroimaging technique. Indeed, ecological egocentric navigation, especially in animal models, is supposed to heavily depend on internally generated cues, such as idiothetic cues (for example, proprioceptive, vestibular, optic flow inputs). In this light, the mandatory absence of actual motion in fMRI, excluding the presence of any idiothetic cue, affects the egocentric-based processing. This pervasive limitation across fMRI studies of egocentric navigation could account at least in part of the similarity between allocentric and egocentric strategies that resulted from our meta-analysis. Secondly, the   a posteriori   assignment of the studies to the egocentric and the allocentric navigational strategies could have weakened the differences in the meta-analysis results due to a mis-classification of studies or the overlapping in the strategies that may be used in performing some tasks. Indeed, the authors did not always explicitly report the kind of strategy their study aimed to analyze. However, in all of the studies the type of strategy the authors had sought for their tasks can be easily detected, even when it is not explicitly described in introduction, by the description of tasks themselves and by the discussion, where authors tried to link their functional findings to specific cognitive processes. Moreover, in most of the studies included in the meta-analysis, authors elicited a specific strategy by adopting paradigmatic tasks specifically developed to tap just a definite strategy rather than explicitly instructing subjects to follow that definite strategy. Thus it is possible that, despite the author\u2019s intention to evaluate the neural bases of a navigational strategy (for example egocentric strategy) by means of a paradigmatic task (for example, a route-following task), actually some subjects perform the task by relying on the other strategy (for example, by relying on an allocentric strategy). It should, however, be consider that this is a common problem in cognitive neuroscience, since we can never be completely sure that subjects perform any experimental task by relying on the strategy authors meant to test. In any case, even being cautious, we retain that present results offer import suggestions for understanding the complex human navigational system and also suggest directions for future studies, which should pay attention in the more clearly defining the strategy analyzed and also in contrasting different strategies in the same study. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions and Future Directions \n  \nOur meta-analysis confirms current models of human navigation, which propose that navigational memory and navigation itself are achieved by means of multi-process systems involving a widespread set of neural areas (Fig.\u00a0 ) (Byrne and Becker  ; Montello  ; Siegel and White  ; Brunsdon et al.  ; Chrastil  ). This meta-analysis allowed us to identify clusters of areas that form specific functional networks, which are selectively involved in different processes. The first differentiation concerns degree of familiarity with the environment. Our data suggest the following: the parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform and lingual gyri are part of a neural system that codes and stores environmental information; the middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal gyrus are responsible for the recall of stored environmental information; the posterior cingulate cortex is more involved in transforming information from the allocentric format, in which it is stored in long-term memory (Byrne and Becker  ), into the egocentric format necessary for driving actual navigation; and the frontal areas are more involved in planning routes in the recalled environments. Partially different networks are also involved in processing allocentric and egocentric representations, which are the core of different navigational strategies. Our results show that, although allocentric representation recruited a subset of areas also involved in egocentric representations, the latter are achieved by means of a specific network including includes the right precuneus and the angular gyrus. Allocentric representations rely on activations of the left superior temporal gyrus, a structure that is also involved in categorical spatial relations and perhaps also in so-called \u201cspatial language\u201d. \n\nFinally, we wish to briefly discuss the involvement of two sets of cerebral areas, revealed by the present ALE, whose roles have been little investigated in human navigation. First, the results revealed a set of frontal areas, which could have a significant role in planning navigation. At the moment, however, it is unclear whether navigational planning is processed by the same systems involved in other types of planning or by specific subsets of frontal areas. Second, the analysis suggests that the cerebellum may have an important role in spatial navigation. But, due to the lack of studies on this issue the specific role of the cerebellum is still unclear. Experimental studies in rodents showed specific reduction of efficiency during navigational tasks performed by cerebellar-damaged rats (Foti et al.  ; review in Petrosini et al.  ) as did neuropsychological studies with patients (Molinari et al.  ; Schmahmann  ). In any case, to our knowledge the role of the cerebellum in human navigation has never been analyzed in detail. Thus, future studies specifically aimed at assessing the role of this region are necessary in order to understand the cerebellar contribution to navigational processes. \n\nBoth of these findings suggest the need for further studies aimed at investigating the role of areas other than those currently considered to be involved in human navigation. \n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material. \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4010721, "text_md5": "b417d750a2275e5b26d1ff2255441471", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 60], "journal": [61, 77], "publication_year": [79, 83], "title": [94, 213], "keywords": [227, 304], "abstract": [317, 2187], "body": [2196, 56877]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 24488500, "doi": "10.1007/s11065-014-9247-8", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4010721", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4010721"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4010721\">4010721</a>", "list_title": "PMC4010721  Neuropsychology of Environmental Navigation in Humans: Review and Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies in Healthy Participants"}

Two independent reviewers performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. We documented sensitivity and specificity for three different MRI findings (white matter abnormalities (WMA), brain abnormality (BA), and diffuse excessive high signal intensity (DEHSI)), related to developmental outcomes including cerebral palsy (CP), visual and/or hearing problems, motor, neurocognitive, and behavioral function. Using bivariate meta-analysis, we estimated pooled sensitivity and specificity and plotted summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves for different cut-offs of MRI. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nWe included 20 papers published between 2000 and 2013. Quality of included studies varied. Pooled sensitivity and specificity values (95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI)) for prediction of CP combining the three different MRI findings (using normal/mild vs. moderate/severe cut-off) were 77\u00a0% (53 to 91\u00a0%) and 79\u00a0% (51 to 93\u00a0%), respectively. For prediction of motor function, the values were 72\u00a0% (52 to 86\u00a0%) and 62\u00a0% (29 to 87\u00a0%), respectively. Prognostic accuracy for visual and/or hearing problems, neurocognitive, and/or behavioral function was poor. sROC curves of the individual MRI findings showed that presence of WMA provided the best prognostic accuracy whereas DEHSI did not show any potential prognostic accuracy. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis study shows that presence of moderate/severe WMA on MRI around term equivalent age can predict CP and motor function in very preterm or low-birth-weight infants with moderate sensitivity and specificity. Its ability to predict other long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive and behavioral impairments is limited. Also, other white matter related tests as BA and DEHSI demonstrated limited prognostic value. \n\n\n## Systematic review registration \n  \n\n\n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13643-015-0058-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nPreterm birth is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental problems [ ]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being used to identify cerebral white matter lesions in the brain of preterm infants at term equivalent age. It is claimed to be a valuable tool to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes in very preterm infants, and its clinical use is, therefore, being promoted [ ,  ]. However, the prognostic accuracy of white matter related MRI abnormalities for long-term developmental outcomes is debatable and its use as a standard of care is not yet recommended by the American Academy of Neurology Quality Standards [ ]. The lack of meta-analytic synthesis of the primary studies reporting prognostic values, which tends to show conflicting results, hampers the debate. \n\nSubsequently, the lack of knowledge about the prognostic accuracy of term MRI hampers an adequate interpretation of this test. This may invoke unwanted effects, as parents may worry unnecessarily about the possible abnormal development of their child [ ,  ]. However, if term MRI can predict neurodevelopmental outcomes accurately, the use of this expensive diagnostic procedure as part of standard care could be justified as it may select high risk infants for prolonged and intensive supportive care. \n\nOur study aims to evaluate the following two questions: \n\n1. What is the prognostic accuracy (in terms of sensitivity and specificity) of white matter related abnormalities seen on term MRI for long-term developmental outcomes of infants born very preterm or with low birth weight? \n\n2. Is there a difference in prognostic accuracy between the three types of white matter abnormalities as seen on term MRI including white matter abnormality, a combination of cerebral white matter lesions defined as \u201cbrain abnormality,\u201d and diffuse excessive high signal intensity? To answer these questions, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the subject. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe performed a systematic review following the guidance of the PRISMA statement, Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy and other recommendations found in the literature [ \u2013 ], with a prospectively published protocol at the Prospero database ( ). \n\n### Search strategy \n  \nWe searched Central, Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo from their inception to November 2013 for relevant studies. The search was performed by a trained clinical librarian (AL) and two other authors (TdH and JvH). Broad text and MeSH terms were used. Also, keywords of eligible papers were screened and included in the final search. We did not apply any language restrictions. The search was limited to studies including humans. The full search in all these databases can be seen in Additional file  . References from included studies were checked. Abstracts and reports from meetings were included only if they related directly to previously published work. \n\n\n### Eligibility criteria \n  \nThe following inclusion criteria were used to select studies: (1) the study pertained to infants born at a gestational age\u2009\u2264\u200932\u00a0weeks and/or birth weight\u2009\u2264\u20091500\u00a0g; (2) MRI should be planned at term equivalent age (37\u201342 weeks) with a maximum range of 3\u00a0weeks earlier or later (34\u201345 weeks); (3) MRI findings should be related to any developmental outcome; and (4) developmental follow-up should be performed \u226518\u00a0months postnatal age. Isolated single case studies and review articles were not included. \n\nAbstracts were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers (JvH and TdH). Full-text articles were retrieved if applicable to the core research question, or if the abstract did not supply sufficient information. Any disagreement was set by discussion until consensus. The same two reviewers appraised the methodological quality and performed the data extraction. Any disagreement at this stage was resolved by a third reviewer. \n\n\n### Methodological quality \n  \nDue to lack of existing quality assessment tools for prognostic accuracy studies, we developed a modified version of the QUADAS-2 assessment tool [ ] to evaluate the risk of bias (see Additional file  ). \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nA standardized data extraction form (see Additional file  ) was used to record study information. The results of white matter abnormalities (WMA) and brain abnormalities (BA) are usually expressed as either no, mild, moderate, or severe abnormalities as described by Inder and Woodward et al. [ ,  ]. Where possible we defined two cut-offs, i.e., (1) no abnormality vs. mild, moderate, or severe abnormality, reported as \u201cnormal vs. any\u201d and (2) no or mild abnormality vs. moderate to severe abnormality, reported as \u2018normal/mild vs. moderate/severe\u2019. BA was defined as a combination of WMA plus presence of other brain abnormalities such as ventricular hemorrhage or increased ventricle size. For diffuse excessive high signal intensity (DEHSI), the results are usually expressed as either present or absent. Therefore, only one cut-off was used in the 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 tables presenting the results for these MRI findings. \n\nThe cut-off point for unfavorable developmental outcome was defined as a minus 2 standard deviations (\u22122SD) difference from the mean for each MRI finding. If this cut-off was not reported (but for example, only a \u22121.25 or \u22121SD), we used the reported cut-off in the meta-analysis. \n\nIn cases of duplicate reporting, i.e., the same cohort was described in two papers or one paper reporting developmental outcomes at different time points of age, we used data from the paper that reported the developmental outcome at a comparable age with the other included papers. For example: if two papers reported motor skills at 2\u00a0years of age and one paper reported at 2 and 6\u00a0years of age, the reporting at 2\u00a0years of age was used. In case two papers reported the same cohort at similar ages, the study with the largest sample size and least quality concerns was selected. If the required data could not be extracted from the publication, authors were contacted by email. All data were entered in Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2012. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nWe performed a meta-analysis using a bivariate modeling approach [ ]. In view of the observed heterogeneity, a random-effects model was used. We compared pooled sensitivity and specificity (95\u00a0% confidence intervals); likelihood ratios of positive and negative test results (LR+/LR\u2212) were calculated from the pooled sensitivity and specificity; diagnostic odds ratios (DOR), and posttest probabilities of three different MRI findings (WMA, BA and DEHSI), for all types of developmental outcomes. Sensitivity and specificity for individual studies and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (sROC) were plotted to visualize possible heterogeneity of data and overall test accuracy. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nOur search strategy yielded 1311 citations after removal of duplicates (Fig.\u00a0 ). A total of 44 papers met the inclusion criteria, of which 27 papers provided 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 tables. One more relevant paper was identified by contact with the authors. After excluding multiple publications from the same cohorts (8 papers), a total of 20 papers were available for the meta-analysis.   \nFlowchart of study selection \n  \n\nThe 20 papers were all published between 2000 and 2013. These papers reported on 12 different cohort studies (2 retrospective and 10 prospective) including 1287 patients (682 male and 605 female). The extracted data provided 54 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 tables for WMA, BA, or DEHSI. These three MRI findings were used for the prediction of various developmental outcomes: cerebral palsy (CP), visual and/or hearing problems, motor, neurocognitive, and behavioral function, as well as a combination of problems in these domains defined as \u2018neurodevelopmental impairment\u2019 (NDI). Study characteristics are shown in Additional file  : Table S1. \n\nStudies from which 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 tables could not be derived (  n  \u2009=\u200917 papers, not reported in this manuscript) reported continuous data with no cut-offs. These studies mostly reported the following MRI tests: cerebellar abnormalities, volumes, and diameter measures of the brain (total brain or specific regions as hippocampus, corpus callosum, or ventricles). \n\n### Methodological quality of included studies \n  \nIn general, 70 to 90\u00a0% of the included studies scored positive on each of the QUADAS-2 quality assessment items (Fig.\u00a0 ). For example, 90\u00a0% of the studies included in the meta-analysis used a consecutive sample of very preterm born and/or low-birth-weight neonates over a specific period of time in their clinic (Fig.\u00a0 ). In general, a good description of the MRI test and reference standard was provided, as well as a verification process to all neonates who had a MRI performed. However, almost 50\u00a0% of the papers did not report blinding of the test results, i.e., results of the MRI findings are not (made) available to the person performing the follow-up neurodevelopmental test.   \nQuality assessment of included studies in meta-analysis (  n  \u2009=\u200920) \n  \n\n\n### Meta-analysis \n  \nThe reported sensitivity and specificity were generally higher for the WMA tests when compared to BA or DEHSI findings (Table\u00a0 ). Fig.\u00a0  shows the sROC curves for prediction of four different developmental delays related to any MRI abnormality (combination of WMA, BA, or DEHSI tests) using a \u2018normal/mild vs. moderate/severe\u2019 cut-off. The sROC curve for prediction of CP shows a curve that lies the most towards the (optimal) upper left corner of the ROC space. Also the sROC curve for prediction of motor function has a tendency to the upper left corner. The sROC curves for mental impairment and neurodevelopmental impairment, which are visualized in Fig.\u00a0 , are heading more towards the diagonal (non-discriminating) line of the ROC space.   \nResults from bivariate analysis on sensitivity (Sens), specificity (Spec), 95\u00a0% confidence interval (95\u00a0% CI), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), positive/negative likelihood ratio (LR+ and LR\u2212), and pretest and posttest probabilities \n  \nIf bivariate model could not estimate 95\u00a0% CI for pooled sensitivity for two studies, estimate is based on study with largest sample size \n\n BA   brain abnormality,   DEHSI   diffuse excessive high signal intensity,   NDI   neurodevelopmental impairment,   WMA   white matter abnormality \n\ndata derived after contact with author \n    \nPooled sensitivity and specificity with sROC reporting four developmental outcomes detected by any MRI abnormality (including white matter abnormality, brain abnormality or diffuse excessive high signal intensity using \u2018normal/mild vs. moderate/severe\u2019 cut-off).   a   (  n  \u2009=\u2009seven studies): pooled sensitivity 77\u00a0% (53 to 91\u00a0%) and specificity 79\u00a0% (51 to 93\u00a0%).   b   (  n  \u2009=\u2009seven studies): pooled sensitivity 72\u00a0% (52 to 86\u00a0%) and specificity 62\u00a0% (29 to 87\u00a0%).   c   (  n  \u2009=\u2009seven studies): pooled sensitivity 66\u00a0% (41 to 84\u00a0%) and specificity 53\u00a0% (35 to 71\u00a0%).   d   (  n  \u2009=\u2009four studies): pooled sensitivity 61\u00a0% (34 to 83\u00a0%) and specificity 85\u00a0% (75 to 92\u00a0%).

Almost similar values were found for the prediction of motor function with a sensitivity of 72\u00a0% (52 to 86\u00a0%) and specificity of 62\u00a0% (29 to 87\u00a0%). Lower values were found for mental development and NDI with sensitivity of 66\u00a0% (41 to 84\u00a0%) and 53\u00a0% (35 to 71\u00a0%), respectively, and specificity of 61\u00a0% (34 to 83\u00a0%) and 85\u00a0% (75 to 92\u00a0%). Using a \u201cnormal vs. any\u201d cut-off, pooled sensitivity and specificity values were 84\u00a0% (45 to 97\u00a0%) and 58\u00a0% (27 to 84\u00a0%) for prediction of CP; 76\u00a0% (48 to 92\u00a0%) and 26\u00a0% (8 to 57\u00a0%) for prediction of motor function; and 85\u00a0% (74 to 92\u00a0%) and 36\u00a0% (20 to 56\u00a0%) for prediction of mental development, respectively. \n\nFigure\u00a0  shows the sROC curves corresponding to the two different cut-offs: \u201cnormal vs. any\u201d and \u201cnormal/mild vs. moderate/severe\u201d when only the results of WMA are taken into consideration for prediction of various developmental outcomes. If only moderate to severe WMA lesions are coded as abnormal (\u201cnormal/mild vs. moderate/severe\u201d), the specificity increases and the sensitivity decreases.   \nPooled sensitivity and specificity with sROC corresponding to two different cut-offs of WMA for prediction of for various developmental outcomes/delays (cerebral palsy, IQ, working memory, visual and/or hearing, mental development, language and motor function delay).   a   Developmental delay in case of \u201cnormal vs. any\u201d WMA (  n  \u2009=\u200913 studies).   b   Developmental delay in case of \u201cnormal/mild vs. moderate/severe\u201d WMA (  n  \u2009=\u200915 studies).

The threshold effect is similar to the shift in sensitivity and specificity as described above, yet without an explicit change in cut-off levels. The shift is presumably the result of an implicit use of a different threshold, e.g., following from subjective judgments or calibration of diagnostic devices. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study shows that the presence of moderate/severe WMA on MRI performed around term equivalent age can predict CP and motor function in very preterm or low-birth-weight neonates with moderate sensitivity and specificity. The ability to predict other long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive and behavioral impairments is limited. Also, other white matter related tests as BA and DEHSI demonstrated limited to no prognostic value. \n\nIn the last decade, the use of MRI as a screening tool for very preterm and low-birth-weight neonates has been a topic of major interest and several reviews have been published on its use [ ,  \u2013 ]. Most of these reviews are narrative (describing practical issues like sedation for MRI and/or different types of MRI techniques) or examined the impact of preterm birth and brain abnormalities on long-term development through the use of MRI. Although none of them systematically reported test accuracy of MRI for prediction of developmental outcome, most of these reviews, however, recommended the use of term MRI in clinical practice. To our best knowledge, our study is the first that systematically reviews the prognostic accuracy of different MRI findings on various long-term developmental outcomes. \n\n### Clinical implications \n  \nThe data in our meta-analysis suggest that presence of moderate/severe WMA has higher positive likelihood ratio, and absence of any WMA has a higher negative likelihood ratio than any other tests that we now use for preterm infants (e.g., cranial ultrasound or neurological examination) [ ]. The prognostic accuracy of WMA finding on MRI therefore supports the use of MRI for preterm infants. However, whether this alters clinical management is a different question. Answering this question was beyond the scope of our meta-analysis. In our opinion however, showing potential prognostic accuracy of a test does not directly justify its clinical use as a standard test. The usefulness of this tool for clinical decision-making requires the presence of possible treatment or specified follow-up strategies following the results of the MRI [ ]. At present, there is no specific treatment available addressing the needs of infants with abnormal white matter on MRI. However, the use of term MRI results may give focus to specific follow-up programs (i.e., offering a screening tool for developmental disorders at an earlier age) or improve selection of neonates for early intervention programs (i.e., physiotherapy or speech therapy). Also, available MRI results may help parents of prematurely born infants to better prepare for the future. \n\nOn the other hand, after screening all very preterm born or low-birth-weight neonates with a term MRI, there is no other tests available with better accuracy. Therefore, the possible harm due to false positive and false negative results must be taken into consideration. The value of being timely informed (value of information) must be weighted against the possibility of unnecessary concern for adverse outcome [ ,  ]. For example, based on the results of this meta-analysis, we can expect that the finding of moderate to severe WMA in a very preterm born child will increase the probability of developing CP from the known prevalence of 7\u00a0% in this population to 37\u00a0% (Table\u00a0 ). This raises the question if this increase in probability will change practice for both the clinician and patient. More specifically, will the clinician offer a different follow-up program when the risk of developing CP is 37\u00a0% instead of 7\u00a0%? And will the negative posttest probability of 2.5\u00a0% (i.e., 2.5\u00a0% will still develop CP after a normal MRI test result) justify a denial of follow-up to those with normal MRI? \n\nOur meta-analysis also shows that adverse outcomes, such as neurocognitive and behavioral impairments, could not be predicted by term MRI abnormalities. Compromised white matter may result in more \u201csubtle\u201d impairments in such areas of the child\u2019s long-term function. The limited prognostic value of WMA for these specific outcomes also suggests that despite MRI abnormalities, whether or not a child develops neurocognitive and behavioral impairments, is also dependent on other factors. Such other factors may include the presence of a stimulating home and/or school environment, educational level of the parents, and therapy use [ ,  ]. \n\nOther considerations relevant to deciding on the use of MRI for the prediction of developmental outcomes are the substantial health care costs associated with its use. In many neonatal units, MRI technology is unavailable or its use is severely restricted. Also, expert neuroradiologists are needed for proper interpretation of the MRI results. In view of its potential prognostic capacity, it is therefore still debatable whether performing a standard term MRI is cost-effective. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis meta-analysis has some limitations that need to be considered. Although a considerable number of studies were identified on the subject, only a limited number of data points were available for each specific combination of MRI findings and neonatal outcome. Although even the results of only two studies can be pooled, the limited number of data points and often limited sample size per study imply limited power (hence wide confidence intervals) [ ]. \n\nAlso, the presence of heterogeneity may raise the question whether pooling of results is justified in our study. In prognostic meta-analysis, two possible reasons for heterogeneity of the data are known i.e.,   clinical   heterogeneity, due to differences in features of the cohorts, and heterogeneity due to   threshold effect  . We estimate a smaller impact of the clinical heterogeneity as all cohorts included consecutive and comparable populations (although inadequate and inconsistent reporting of possible confounders in the studies, e.g., use of medication, birth weight, and presence of neonatal complications during admission, made it impossible to correct for potential confounders in our meta-analysis). Heterogeneity due to threshold effect is a common occurrence in many diagnostic test systematic reviews and probably explaining most of the heterogeneity in our meta-analysis [ ]. The threshold effect in MRI tests is explained by the relative subjectivity of interpretations of MRI results e.g., one lesion on the MRI might be seen as abnormal for one radiologist but not by another. Also the use of different scoring systems and differences in background of the evaluators (neonatologists or radiologist) contribute to this type of heterogeneity. For this review, heterogeneity due to different scoring systems is probably the case in studies describing \u201cbrain abnormalities.\u201d These studies not only include WMA as one of the MRI findings but also a composite of other MRI findings (i.e., IVH and/or increased ventricle size). However, since this heterogeneous definition of \u201cbrain abnormality\u201d reflects common practice, we included these diverging MRI findings. \n\nFurthermore, the quality of the included studies varied. In general, the majority of the studies were of good quality, although the lack of reporting of blinding of the MRI test at follow-up assessment in almost 50\u00a0% of the papers is a point of concern. However, in view of the limited number of included studies, subgroup analyses by excluding low quality studies is unlikely to resolve this question, as it would merely lead to broader confidence intervals [ ]. As with all reviews, this systematic review is susceptible to publication bias. Especially cohort studies that did not show any predictive value of MRI have a lower chance of being published. The effect of publication bias may have resulted to overestimation of the predictive value of MRI in our meta-analysis. \n\n\n### Recommendations for clinical care and further research \n  \nThere is a solid evidence that very preterm birth and low birth weight has negative consequences on motor, neurocognitive, and behavioral functioning [ ,  ,  ]. Preterm birth is also associated with variable degrees of brain injury and reduced brain volumes [ ,  ]. A multitude of possible confounding factors play a role in the developmental outcomes of these fragile infants. Although MRI results can add valuable information on the prediction of long-term development, this information is in our opinion too marginal to use it on its own. A next step to consider is the performance of an individual patient data (IPD) analysis gathering the results from the individual level. First, this will enhance correction of confounders of the different cohort studies. Second, this extensive data-analyses technique may be used to develop a prognostic model, in which the presence of WMA on MRI can be combined with other biomarkers known to influence long-term development such as gender, neonatal history, clinical symptoms as infection [ ], poor nutrition [ ], use of steroids [ ], low birth weight, socio-demographic factors, other imaging techniques as ultrasonography [ ], or other promising MRI techniques that might show moderate prognostic accuracy in the near future (e.g., MR spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI)) [ ]. A model statistically combining various relevant prognostic factors likely increases the accuracy to predict outcomes and may therefore be a more valuable tool for clinical use than MRI on its own. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis meta-analysis shows that the presence of moderate/severe WMA on MRI around term equivalent age can predict CP and motor function in very preterm or low-birth-weight neonates with moderate sensitivity and specificity. The ability to predict other long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive and behavioral impairments is limited. Before considering the use of this test as a standard test in clinical practice, we encourage the continued use of routine MRI in a research setting to generate further evidence on its prognostic capacity together with other prognostic factors. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 4438620, "text_md5": "4ed55198e5c7525bb93a5009cd2f0348", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 178], "journal": [179, 187], "publication_year": [189, 193], "title": [204, 318], "keywords": [332, 379], "abstract": [392, 2708], "body": [2717, 26755]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 25982565, "doi": "10.1186/s13643-015-0058-7", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4438620", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=4438620"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4438620\">4438620</a>", "list_title": "PMC4438620  Predicting developmental outcomes in premature infants by term equivalent MRI: systematic review and meta-analysis"}

The specific neural correlates of this construct are still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to conduct a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 42 fMRI studies on visual vWM in healthy subjects (  n   = 795, males = 459, females = 325, unknown = 11; age range: 18\u201375). The studies were obtained after an exhaustive literature search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Brainmap database. We analyzed regional activation differences during fMRI tasks with the anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based d mapping software (ES-SDM). The results were further validated by performing jackknife sensitivity analyses and heterogeneity analyses. We investigated the effect of numerous relevant influencing factors by fitting corresponding linear regression models. We isolated consistent activation in a network containing fronto-parietal areas, right cerebellum, and basal ganglia structures. Regarding lateralization, the results pointed toward a bilateral frontal activation, a left-lateralization of parietal regions and a right-lateralization of the cerebellum, indicating that the left-hemisphere concept of vWM should be reconsidered. We also isolated activation in regions important for response inhibition, emphasizing the role of attentional control in vWM. Moreover, we found a significant influence of mean reaction time, load, and age on activation associated with vWM. Activation in left medial frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and left precentral gyrus turned out to be positively associated with mean reaction time whereas load was associated with activation across the PFC, fusiform gyrus, parietal cortex, and parts of the cerebellum. In the latter case activation was mainly detectable in both hemispheres whereas the influence of age became manifest predominantly in the left hemisphere. This led us to conclude that future vWM studies should take these factors into consideration. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nWorking memory (WM) is a cognitive system that holds information available that is needed for complex cognition in the present moment (Baddeley,  ; Oberauer and Hein,  ). It has been shown that WM capacity is a strong predictor of a wide range of complex cognitive tasks such as analytic problem solving, language acquisition, and reading comprehension (Daneman and Carpenter,  ; Engle et al.,  ; Wiley and Jarosz,  ). There have been several attempts to understand the organization of human WM. The arguably most influential model is the multiple-component model proposed by Baddeley and Hitch ( ). The authors hypothesized the existence of a \u201ccentral executive\u201d component, which controls the incoming information and passes the information to two subsystems: the \u201cphonological loop\u201d and the \u201cvisuospatial sketchpad.\u201d Within the phonological loop, due to the interplay of its two components\u2014the phonological store and the articulatory loop\u2014the verbal material representation can be kept in an active state. Verbal information is processed in perceptual systems before it enters the phonological loop in which it is temporarily stored in the phonological store and maintained through the articulatory loop using subvocal rehearsal of the information. In addition to subvocal rehearsal, the articulatory loop is also thought to be involved whenever verbal information is presented visually: whereas auditory verbal information (e.g., spoken words) can directly enter the phonological store, visually presented verbal information (e.g., written words) must first be recoded into phonological information. In other words, subvocalization is necessary in order to reroute visually derived verbal material into the phonological store (Buchsbaum and D'Esposito,  ). The visuospatial sketchpad is responsible for integrating visual and spatial information. Later, the \u201cepisodic buffer\u201d was added (Baddeley,  ). It binds the information from the different subsystems into integrated episodes. Alternative models proposed that WM holds any type of information in a state of heightened availability (Oberauer,  ; Cowan et al.,  ) whereas others models have emphasized on the role of attentional control in WM (e.g., Kane and Engle,  ; Unsworth and Engle,  ). These different theoretical conceptualizations of WM are not necessarily mutually exclusive (Cowan et al.,  ), with common features including a variety of processes such as encoding, maintaining and retrieving information of various domains (e.g., letters, geometric forms, or words), and some attentional control mechanism that supports dealing with interference from irrelevant or distracting information. Thus, the neural correlates of WM may vary depending on the processes, the type of information, and the modality of stimulation (auditory or visual). Given the variety across studies with regard to WM domain and the lack of process differentiation in most studies, the present meta-analysis focused exclusively on visually presented verbal working memory (vWM) across all processes involved in WM. \n\n### Visual Verbal Working Memory \n  \nSeveral fMRI studies over the past years have specifically investigated the brain areas involved in vWM (Honey et al.,  ; Veltman et al.,  ; Chen and Desmond,  ; Narayanan et al.,  ; Wolf et al.,  ). They basically corroborated the general notion that a variety of brain networks are activated during vWM mainly including areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the parietal cortex as well as cerebellar and basal ganglia regions (Paulesu et al.,  ; Petrides et al.,  ; Desmond et al.,  ; Crosson et al.,  ; Lewis et al.,  ; Chang et al.,  ; Buchsbaum et al.,  ; Th\u00fcrling et al.,  ; Moore et al.,  ; Chai et al.,  ). Previous meta-analyses have indicated that the left PFC might be predominantly involved in vWM processes whereas the right PFC seems to be more strongly involved in spatial WM, leading to a lateralization of this region due to different input (Wager and Smith,  ; Owen et al.,  ). However, there is no general consensus on the functional organization of the PFC (Eriksson et al.,  ). Functional neuroimaging studies suggested that the articulatory loop is associated with the left inferior frontal cortex\u2014where Broca's area is located \u2013, left supplementary motor area (SMA), left premotor cortex (BA6), and left insula. The phonological store has been shown to be associated with the left BA 40, corresponding to the left supramarginal gyrus located in the left inferior parietal lobule. Thus, these regions are essential for any kind of vWM task (Paulesu et al.,  ; Smith and Jonides,  ; Henson et al.,  ; Buchsbaum and D'Esposito,  ). Moreover, parietal activation has been interpreted as a buffer for modality-specific information. Whereas, the relevance of prefrontal and parietal regions for vWM has long been recognized, the cerebellum came into focus only some years ago. Originally regarded mainly as a structure involved in motor control and coordination, its involvement in higher-order cognitive processes, such as vWM, is no longer called into question (Ravizza et al.,  ; Hayter et al.,  ; Cooper et al.,  ; Th\u00fcrling et al.,  ; Tomlinson et al.,  ). More specifically, it has been suggested that the cerebellum plays a relevant role in subvocal rehearsal, but the specific contribution of the cerebellum to the various processes involved in vWM is still a matter of debate (Desmond et al.,  ; Pleger and Timmann,  ). Like the cerebellum, the basal ganglia (BG) are critical structures for motor control by enhancing desired motor behaviors and suppressing undesired ones (Alexander et al.,  ; Mink,  ). In addition, the BG are involved in various cognitive processes, such as language production and working memory (McNab et al.,  ). Again, for many years, fMRI studies on vWM tended to focus on cortical structures such as parietal and frontal regions, underestimating the relevance of BG structures such as caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. Finally, limbic areas, such as cingulate, are known to be involved in vWM, but its contribution has likewise long been underestimated (Moore et al.,  ). \n\n\n### Influencing Factors in the Neural Correlates of vWM \n  \nActivation in these brain regions can be influenced by several factors, such as age, gender, and type and difficulty (i.e., WM load) of the fMRI task. Moreover, the activation can be assumed to depend on individual performance (e.g., response velocity/speed as assessed by mean response times) and the statistical threshold which analyses are based on. \n\n\n### Age \n  \nOlder adults compared to younger adults have been found to show a more bilateral pattern of prefrontal cortex activity under comparable task demands, a finding which constituted the basis of the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD) model (Cabeza,  ; Cabeza et al.,  ). One hypothesis is that bilateral activity in older adults could reflect a functional compensatory mechanism, in which age-related asymmetry reductions compensate neurocognitive decline leading to a less lateralized brain activity. This is known as the compensation view. A second hypothesis is the so-called dedifferentiation view which assumes a less specific recruitment of neural networks due to gradual changes occurring with age. In a PET study, Reuter-Lorenz et al. ( ) showed that PFC activity in younger adults was left lateralized for verbal and right lateralized for spatial stimuli, whereas older adults presented a bilateral PFC activation for verbal and visual tasks. This model is not only supported by functional neuroimaging results but also by behavioral results from a letter matching task (Reuter-lorenz et al.,  ). Apart from these models, a number of other theories related to age differences in brain activation have been proposed, such as the Posterior-Anterior Shift in Aging (PASA). This theory assumes both frontal over-activation and posterior midline cortex under-activation in older adults compared to younger ones (Davis et al.,  ). The Compensation-Related Utilization of Neural Circuits Hypothesis (CRUNCH) proposes that people will activate more cortical regions if task difficulty increases (Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell,  ). Finally, the Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition (STAC and STAC-r) suggests that the increased frontal activation with age is a marker of the adaptive human brain indicating a compensation for the structural and functional decline going along with aging (Park and Reuter-Lorenz,  ). This theory takes a holistic view by considering compensation a normal process involved in our daily lives in order to be able to achieve our goals. \n\n\n### Gender \n  \nThe influence of gender in the context of WM and, more specifically, vWM, is still rather controversial, with some studies reporting no gender effects (Bell et al.,  ; Schmidt et al.,  ) and others reporting significant differences between male and female participants (Lejbak et al.,  ; Zilles et al.,  ). The controversial results might be due to the potential influence of sex hormones, which have been shown to influence several cognitive functions including vWM (Mordecai et al.,  ; Joseph et al.,  ). Sex hormones are known to fluctuate with, for instance, menstrual cycle or hormonal contraception. However, most studies did not provide any information on these aspects which may explain the result heterogeneity to some degree. \n\n\n### Additional Factors (Tasks, Load, Mean, Reaction Time) \n  \nA previous meta-analysis showed differences in brain activity due to WM task type (Rottschy et al.,  ). They found that n-back and Sternberg tasks, which are typical fMRI WM tasks, not only showed differences in mental processes but also in brain activation. Moreover, tasks can vary in their difficulty through modulating the WM load (i.e., the number of items that need to be remembered). Load effects reflect the neural activation related to the increasing memory demands of information (Cowan et al.,  ; Cowan,  ). Rottschy et al. ( ) found that load effects were mainly associated with activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, Honey et al. ( ) demonstrated that prolonged mean reaction times (RT) in response to a vWM task could influence activation in WM related brain regions. Therefore, these findings suggest that all the previously mentioned potential factors should be taken into consideration. \n\n\n### Aim of the Study \n  \nAgainst this background, the first aim of the present study was to provide an updated and extended meta-analysis of the neural correlates of vWM in healthy humans using a coordinate-based meta-analysis. The second aim was to find out more about the role of the potential moderators (age, gender, type and difficulty of the fMRI task, mean RT, and statistical threshold). Although task performance which is related to the difficulty level could be another potential factor, it was not taken into consideration due to the heterogeneous assessment in the selected studies (i.e., absolute correct values, percentage of correct values, accuracy) as pointed also by Meule ( ). To our knowledge this is the first meta-analysis to study these factors in vWM. A better knowledge about their influence on the neural correlates of vWM will increase understanding of the general mechanisms of vWM as well as help to improve methods and analyses of future vWM studies. \n\n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Literature Search and Inclusion of Studies \n  \nAn exhaustive literature search was conducted on whole-brain fMRI studies on vWM from January 2000 to December 2017. We searched the databases PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science for English-language studies with the combination of the following key words: \u201cn-back,\u201d \u201cDMTS,\u201d \u201cSternberg,\u201d \u201ddelayed matched to sample,\u201d \u201cdelayed match to sample,\u201d plus \u201cverbal working memory,\u201d \u201cfMRI,\u201d \u201chealthy.\u201d The Brainmap database was also searched with their respective search criteria (Subjects Size is more than 10, Experiments Paradigm Class is Delayed Match to Sample/n-back, Experiments Imaging Modality is fMRI, Conditions Stimulus is Visual Letters, and Subjects Handedness is Right). Further studies (11 publications) were identified through chasing citations from the selected studies (see   for flowchart diagram). The \u201cMeta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology\u201d (MOOSE) guidelines Stroup et al. ( ) were used for the literature search and selection of studies. All articles were identified, selected and coded by a single investigator (M.E.). The same investigator double-checked the manually extracted peak coordinates and effect size values from the selected studies. \n  \nFlowchart diagram of selected papers. \n  \nThe criteria for inclusion were whole-brain analyses with reported results in a standard reference space (Talairach or MNI), inclusion of more than 10 healthy subjects and studies with clear boundaries between inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were excluded if they only included region-of-interests (ROI) analyses, did not report peak coordinates, investigated between- or within-group effects of pharmacological treatment, disease, living conditions, or used reward trials or emotional retrieval. We also excluded studies that re-analyzed previously reported data to avoid overestimating the effects. Positron emission tomography (PET) experiments were also not included in this meta-analysis due to methodological differences (e.g., differences in temporal resolution between PET and MRI) and differences in the underlying physiology (i.e., BOLD contrast vs. glucose mechanism). \n\n\n### Comprehensive Meta-Analysis \n  \nWe first conducted a meta-analysis of all the vWM studies. The demographic and study characteristics are shown in  . The vast majority of the selected studies used the SPM software ( ) to perform their fMRI analyses (83.3% of studies) indicating a clear bias toward this software package. Coordinates and   t  -values included in the analysis are shown in  . When only   p  - or   z  -values were reported, they were transformed into   t  -values taking into account the sample size per study. The influence of gender (% female), mean age, type of fMRI task (DMTS including the Sternberg task or n-back), mean RT, and the type of threshold used in the study (uncorrected vs. corrected) were studied with meta-regressions. The majority of studies corrected for multiple comparisons by controlling the false-discovery rate (FDR), except for one study that used the family-wise error rate (FWE) and another one that used Bonferroni correction. Those studies presenting results with peak coordinates at   p   < 0.005 or   p   < 0.001 uncorrected (33.3%) controlled for the cluster-size with different thresholds (5, 8, 10, 17, or 25 contiguous voxels). On a side note\u2014although IQ and years of education have been shown to be associated with WM performance (Fukuda et al.,  ; Boller et al.,  ), we could not assess these factors here because the majority of studies did not provide any information on IQ or years of education. \n  \nCharacteristics of the 42 fMRI studies included in the meta-analysis. \n  \nn, sample size; SD, standard deviation; NA, not announced; % Fem, percentage of female participants; L, level; E, encoding; M, maintenance; R, recall; RT, reaction time. \n  \nThere are several established fMRI vWM paradigms: n-back, Sternberg, and delayed matching to sample (DMTS) tasks (Kirchner,  ; Sternberg,  ; Paule et al.,  ). N-back tasks include a sequential presentation of stimuli. Subjects have to decide whether the current stimulus is the same as the one   n   positions before (e.g., the previous one in a 1-back condition or the one two positions back in a 2-back condition). In Sternberg tasks, a set of stimuli is presented simultaneously that need to be maintained over a certain period which is followed by a single probe stimulus for which participants need to decide whether it was part of the set or not. In DMTS tasks, a single stimulus is presented. After the maintenance period, a set of multiple probes is presented from which participants need to recognize the single stimulus they had to memorize. While n-back tasks are normally presented in the form of a block-design, DMTS and Sternberg tasks are presented in an event-related design. \n\n\n### Load-Effect Meta-Analysis \n  \nTo assess the neural correlates of increasing vWM load (i.e., the difficulty of the fMRI task), we performed a load-effect meta-analysis. We only included studies in which there was a contrast between higher and lower vWM loads, such as 3-back vs. 1-back or 3-back vs. 2-back. The selected studies are shown in  . \n\n\n### Meta-Analytical Approach: ES-SDM \n  \nWe used the anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based d' mapping software ( ) to conduct coordinate-based meta-analyses. The software uses a voxel-based meta-analytic approach. First, a strict selection of the reported peak coordinates of gray matter differences was applied by only including the studies containing whole-brain analyses. This is essential in order to avoid biased results from some neuroimaging studies, in which more liberal statistical thresholds were used for some ROIs relative to the rest of the brain. Peak coordinates in MNI or Talairach and effect size values were manually extracted from each contrast of interest in each study. All p- or z-values were transformed into   t  -values using SDM web utilities. Second, a map for the activation in gray matter was created for each study using the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas partitioned into 116 brain regions (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al.,  ). If a study included more than one contrast of interest, we adjusted for multiple contrasts by combining the created images of each contrast into one image for the final analyses. The ES-SDM software re-creates the maps from the studies by converting the   t  -value of each peak to Hedge's g (Alegria et al.,  ). Third, an anisotropic non-normalized Gaussian kernel was applied by assigning different values to the different neighboring voxels based on the spatial correlation between them (Radua et al.,  ). At the end, we obtained a mean map by a voxelwise calculation of the mean of the study maps, weighted by the square root of the sample size, so that studies with larger sample sizes contributed more strongly (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). \n\nTo assess the robustness of the main findings, we performed a whole-brain Jackknife analysis. Jackknife analysis consists of repeating the statistical analyses several times by discarding one study each time thus demonstrating the stability of the results (M\u00fcller et al.,  ). Heterogeneity of effect sizes and publication bias were assessed with the   I   index and Egger's test (Egger et al.,  ; M\u00fcller et al.,  ). The   I   index provides the proportion of variability across studies that is due to true heterogeneity relative to that from sampling error (Higgins and Thompson,  ). Egger's tests were used to test for asymmetry of funnel plots, serving as an indicator of publication bias (see   for examples). \n\nStatistical significance was determined with random-effects models. We used the default threshold for the calculated mean (voxel-level   p   < 0.005 uncorrected, peak height threshold 1, minimum cluster extent 10 contiguous voxels) (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). To control for multiple testing in the several meta-regressions we used a more conservative threshold, Bonferroni-corrected threshold of   p   < 0.001. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (42 Studies) \n  \nThe mean map of brain regions of the whole-brain meta-analysis for vWM is shown in  . The majority of studies reported only task-positive activation. We observed extended activation patterns in the frontal lobe including left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), medial frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), triangular, orbital and opercular part of the right IFG, orbital and opercular part of the left IFG, bilateral SMA, bilateral precentral gyrus, and left rolandic operculum. There was also activation in parietal areas including left post-central gyrus, right angular gyrus, and left inferior parietal gyri (IPG). Moreover, there was activation in the bilateral median cingulate, the left insula, the right lenticular nucleus (i.e., putamen and pallidum) and in bilateral cerebellum (crus I). \n  \nNeural correlates of vWM estimated by meta-analysis. Results are displayed at   p   < 0.005 (cluster size \u226510) projected on the MNI 151 T1 template. \n  \nRobustness analyses showed that these results were preserved in all studies. Egger's tests indicated that there were some regions for which there was evidence of heterogeneity: left SFG, left SMA, left precentral gyrus, left post-central gyrus, right angular gyrus, left IPG, right median cingulate, left insula, and right cerebellum (crus I) (see  ). \n  \nComprehensive meta-analysis results. \n  \n Only one local peak per gray matter regions is displayed. Robustness analyses displayed for clusters>100 voxels (as in Fullana et al.,  ). MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; SDM, signed differential mapping; I , percentage of variance attributable to study heterogeneity; JK, jackknife sensitivity test; L., left; R., right  . \n  \nMeta-regression analyses confirmed that mean age and mean RT moderated activation in some brain regions. Mean age was associated with decreased activation in the left rolandic operculum, left insula, left superior temporal gyrus (STG), left IFG (opercular part), left heschl gyrus, left post-central gyrus, left lenticular nucleus (putamen), and the right MFG. Mean RT was positively associated with activation in the left precentral gyrus and the left MFG (see   and  ). None of the other meta-regression analyses yielded any significant results. \n  \nMeta-regression results. Results are displayed at   p   < 0.001 on MNI 152 2009.

Moreover, there was activation in several parietal areas (left post-central gyrus, left angular gyrus, left SPG, and bilateral IPG) as well as in the left anterior cingulate gyri, bilateral median cingulate gyri, left fusiform gyrus, and right cerebellum (crus I and hemispheric lobule VI) (see  ). \n  \nLoad-effect meta-analysis results. \n  \n Only one local peak per gray matter regions is displayed. Robustness analyses displayed for clusters>100 voxels (as in Fullana et al.,  ). MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute; SDM, signed differential mapping; I , percentage of variance attributable to study heterogeneity; JK, jackknife sensitivity test; R., right; L., left  . \n  \nJackknife analyses showed that the findings were preserved across studies, except for the right rolandic operculum and left fusiform gyrus, which were no longer detectable after discarding two papers. We only observed heterogeneity in the right inferior parietal gyrus (see  ). \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present comprehensive meta-analysis across 42 whole-brain vWM fMRI tasks showed vWM processing to be based on a fronto-parieto-cerebellar network and to involve also subcortical regions such as the cingulate, left insula and right lenticular nucleus. Thus, the present results corroborate previously discussed networks, but also provide evidence for the involvement of additional regions that have been neglected in the past in the discussion of vWM processing. \n\n### Dual-Selection Model \n  \nA tentative explanation of the results is provided by the dual-selection model. Nee et al. ( ) proposed this model based on a meta-analysis of 36 event-related fMRI studies aimed at understanding the executive processes of WM. According to this model the caudal superior frontal sulcus (SFS) is associated with a spatial selection while the mid-lateral PFC is especially sensitive to non-spatial content, matching the \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d based selections, respectively. This proposal was further corroborated by a previous meta-analysis of 24 experiments based on an n-back task (Owen et al.,  ). The results of the present meta-analysis lend further support to the dual-selection model given that we also found activation of the mid-lateral PFC (bilateral IFG, right MFG, and medial part of the left SFG). The left SFG appeared to be a heterogeneous region. The fact that we found a noticeable bilateral prefrontal activation in this meta-analysis suggests that the assumption of a strongly left-lateralized verbal WM activation in PFC should be reconsidered. However, it needs to be clarified that we did not include studies systematically comparing spatial vs. non-spatial WM. Therefore, these conclusions need to be drawn with caution because the mere fact that we found the same activation does not fully support the dual-selection model. \n\n\n### Phonological Loop \n  \nWe did not find activation of the left supramarginal gyrus, which is known to be important for the phonological store, but instead in the region where the supramarginal gyrus is located, the left inferior parietal cortex. The activation of this region was found to be heterogeneous, which tends to be in line with the hypothesis of Buchsbaum and D'Esposito ( ). They argue that the phonological store does not precisely correspond to a single specific functional brain region, but rather is associated with several brain regions that underlie neural processes from perception and production of speech. Surprisingly, the present meta-analysis did not reveal any activation in the Wernicke area although this is an essential area for the comprehension and/or production of verbal material (Binder,  ). This area is assumed to comprise mainly the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus as well as the occipito-parieto-temporal junction including the angular gyrus. However, the exact location of the Wernicke area is still a matter of debate also due to its comprehensive and partly heterogeneous functionality in the context of verbal processing. Moreover, the fact that we used the AAL atlas, which comprises relatively large brain regions, might also explain why we were not able to isolate activation of this specific and somewhat ill-defined region. The fact that we did not find any activation in the right parietal cortex was also expected, since this region is assumed to serve spatial rehearsal. Hence, as opposed to the bilateral activation in the prefrontal cortex, activation in the parietal cortex turned out to be strongly left-lateralized, presumably due to modality. As predicted, we also found activation in the left IFG containing the Broca's area, as well as in the left SMA, which are components central to the articulatory loop. The fact that we did not find any activation in the premotor cortex could also be due to the atlas used. The AAL atlas does not contain this region because the labeled SMA embeds both the premotor cortex and the pre-SMA. Therefore, we cannot exclude that there was specific activation of the premotor cortex. In addition, there was activation in the left rolandic operculum, which is caudally adjacent to Broca's area. It has been demonstrated that this brain area is involved in speech production (Koelsch et al.,  ) and speech prosody processing (Wu et al.,  ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first WM meta-analysis isolating activation specifically in this area. This finding may indicate that the majority of the participants used an overt rehearsal strategy during the vWM tasks. Further studies testing the impact of the opportunity for rehearsal during vWM tasks on brain activation are however needed to confirm this hypothesis. \n\n\n### Attentional Control \n  \nMany conceptualizations of WM include an attentional control mechanism that supports dealing with interferences such as from other items in memory. The right IFG has been proposed to be an important region for attentional control (Aron et al.,  ; Forstmann et al.,  ). Specifically, Aron et al. 's ( ) data strongly suggest that response inhibition is uniquely located in the right IFG, in particular in its triangular part. The data were acquired by studying patients with lesions of the right frontal lobe during a go/no-go task. Forstmann et al. ( ) found a direct linkage between structural and functional properties of the right IFG, and its role in response inhibition. Another fMRI study (Aron and Poldrack,  ) found that the IFG targets the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and regions in its vicinity. The STN sends excitatory projections to the globus pallidus externus, which, in turn, suppresses the thalamo-cortical output; this is assumed to lead to an inhibition of the initiated response. Finally, a strongly right-lateralized network comprising the right IFG, the STN, and also the pre-SMA, is recruited during response suppression (Aron,  ). It remains unclear, however, whether the right IFG triggers the STN directly or via the pre-SMA (Aron et al.,  ). We found a strong activation of the right IFG, especially in the triangular part, the right SMA\u2014which also includes the pre-SMA in this atlas \u2013, and the right pallidum, giving support to the idea that these areas constitute a network subserving response inhibition in the context of vWM processing. Indeed, a substantial body of behavioral research has found that attentional control as employed in response inhibition tasks is related to WM capacity (Kane and Engle,  ; Unsworth and Engle,  , but see Rey-Mermet et al.,  ). Notably, heterogeneity analyses confirmed the stability of these networks indicating that activation in these regions is not likely due to a possible publication bias. However, it is important to mention that the selected studies did not manipulate attention. The fact that we found activation in the same areas that mediate response inhibition in other experimental contexts does not completely mean that they do so in the context of vWM. \n\nIn addition to the IFG, the angular gyrus has been found to be activated in the context of response inhibition (Wager et al.,  ). The angular gyrus is located in the posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule and has been found to be activated in a variety of tasks (Seghier,  ). Some anatomical studies (Makris et al.,  ,  ; Uddin et al.,  ) define the angular gyrus as an important seed point, given its strong interaction with temporo-frontal subsystems as well as regions such as hippocampus, caudate, and precuneus. It is a key component of the default-mode network and shows activation in most tasks demanding information retrieval (Spaniol et al.,  ; Kim,  ). The role of this region in memory retrieval is plausible given its strong connectivity with the hippocampus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the right angular gyrus appears in a vWM meta-analysis. Considering that this region has been reported to be important for inhibition and retrieval we conclude that the activation of the angular gyrus in the present meta-analysis may predominantly reflect the employment of attentional control during information retrieval. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of this region's activity being found due to presence of publication bias in the selected literature. Further studies allowing for a separate analysis of the retrieval process are however needed to further explore this assumption. \n\n\n### Cerebellar and Subcortical Activations \n  \nIt has been shown that cerebellum is connected not only to motor areas, but also to prefrontal cortical areas (Schmahmann,  ); this suggests an involvement of the cerebellum in higher-order cognitive processes. A distinct cross-cerebro-cerebellar circuitry for vWM has been proposed with predominant involvement of right cerebellum, especially the lobule VI (Ng et al.,  ). In accordance with this proposal, earlier studies already pointed at the relevance of the right cerebellum in the context of vWM. Using inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) Tomlinson et al. ( ) found that participants were less accurate during a verbal version of the Sternberg task if a trial was preceded by a stimulation of the right cerebellar hemisphere. Moreover, patients with right-sided cerebellar lesions have been found to be impaired in verbal memory, whereas patients with left cerebellar lesions turned out to be slower in a visuospatial task (Hokkanen et al.,  ). All these findings suggest a lateralized function of the cerebellum with its right hemisphere contributing mainly to verbal and its left hemisphere to visuospatial processing. Moreover, a meta-analysis (Stoodley and Schmahmann,  ) analyzing cerebellum neuroimaging studies found that regions involved in vWM studies overlap with those involved in language tasks which is in agreement with domain-specific storage modules as in Baddeley's model. It corroborates the idea that vWM is more right-lateralized with a strong activation occurring mostly at the junction lobule VI/Crus I. Our results showing a significantly stronger activation in the right cerebellum (crus I) support this hypothesis. A case study of a right cerebellar hemispherectomy in an 18-years-old patient reported that the patient suffered from a disproportionate impairment of the rehearsal system, while the phonological store was preserved (Silveri et al.,  ). This could be due to anatomical connections between Broca's area, left SMA, right lobule VI and crus I of the cerebellum (Schmahmann,  ). However, in the present meta-analysis, we did not differentiate between those processes and, thus, we cannot further investigate whether the right cerebellum is mainly involved in rehearsal. Still, our analysis provides clear evidence for the relevance of the right cerebellum, especially crus I, in the context of vWM processing. Further studies disentangling the different vWM processes are warranted to elucidate the specific function of the right cerebellum in vWM. \n\nApart from the cerebellum, a number of additional subcortical areas are assumed to be relevant for vWM. Thus, basal ganglia regions, especially the caudate and the lenticular nucleus, have been found to be activated during encoding and maintenance phases during vWM tasks (Lewis et al.,  ; Chang et al.,  ; Moore et al.,  ). Although in the present meta-analysis basal ganglia activation was restricted to the right lenticular nucleus, it remains unclear whether the activation is ascribable to these processes. Again, we were unable to distinguish between the different vWM processes given the available data. Caudate, putamen and capsular regions are known to receive afferents from the left pre-SMA region, which is involved in vWM (Inase et al.,  ). Crosson et al. ( ) found that basal ganglia activity was accompanied by activation of the left pre-SMA during a word production task. They hypothesized that the increase of right basal ganglia activation serves to suppress the non-dominant right frontal cortex, whereas the increase of the left basal ganglia activation serves to enhance the language processing of the left dominant hemisphere. Against the background of these findings, the basal ganglia can be assumed to interact closely with the frontal cortex and to serve as a selective gating mechanism for the prefrontal cortex (Frank et al.,  ). From this perspective, the findings showing the basal ganglia to be active only during encoding and maintenance phases seem plausible, because selective gating plays a major role for these processes. However, as we did not study the phases separately, we cannot rule out that these activations also reflect attentional processes in addition to pure vWM processes. Moreover, six publications compared activation conditions with a simple baseline (e.g., fixation of a cross hair). Hence, we cannot rule out that some parts of the subcortical activation were due to motor activity (i.e., button press in the activation conditions vs. no button press in the baseline condition). In the present meta-analysis we also found left pre-SMA activation, but a conclusion about their influence on basal ganglia is unwarranted without any connectivity data. In addition to the pre-SMA activation, our meta-analysis demonstrated significant activation in the anterior cingulate which has been found to be activated during vWM tasks before (Bedwell et al.,  ; Narayanan et al.,  ). It should be noted that in the AAL atlas the significant cluster was labeled as median cingulate, which is part of the anterior cingulate. It is striking, however, that a majority of vWM did not find an involvement of the anterior cingulate. Hence, future studies should make an attempt to clarify the specific contribution of the different parts of the cingulate to vWM. \n\n\n### Age, Load, and Mean RT as Influencing Factors \n  \nAge-related changes in vWM are not fully understood because of a lack of longitudinal data. A recent longitudinal study found the activation of left prefrontal cortex (i.e., MFG and parts of the IFG) to be reduced during a vWM manipulation task in older people (Rieckmann et al.,  ). Somewhat in accordance with this finding, the present meta-analysis demonstrated a negative association between activation in the left and right IFG\u2014including Broca's area\u2014and age. In addition, we found a negative association between activation in the right MFG and age. It is known that cortical thickness, surface area, and volume of this region decrease with age (Lemaitre et al.,  ) which may, to some degree, explain this finding. Moreover, the right MFG plays a central role in reorienting attention from exogenous to endogenous attentional control (Japee et al.,  ). Our results are in agreement with the ontogenetic model of brain development according to which those brain regions that are the last to mature are the first to be affected by aging (Raz et al.,  ). Of note, all the other regions exhibiting a negative association between activation and age were localized in the left hemisphere. We found this negative association in the left insula, which\u2014as stated above\u2014plays a relevant role in the context of rehearsal, in the left putamen, which is involved in the active filtering of irrelevant material allowing us to focus on relevant material (Moore et al.,  ) in the left rolandic operculum, important for overt rehearsal, and in the left superior temporal gyrus, parts of which are critically involved in phonological storage. The fact that these regions important for different vWM processes showed a negative association with age might explain why older people tend to exhibit worse vWM performance, although it should be kept in mind that we did not take into account any longitudinal data or individual subject performance. Since these associations were detectable mainly in the left hemisphere and age-related changes were not restricted to the right PFC, our results seem to speak against the HAROLD model (Cabeza et al.,  ). Overall, the present results do not provide any evidence for a decrease of this lateralization with age, as claimed in other studies (Reuter-Lorenz et al.,  ; Cabeza et al.,  ,  ). The fact that we found a decreased frontal activation with increasing age could either mean that the brain is not as adaptive as proposed by the earlier discussed STAC model or indicate that task demands were too high for elderly people leading to a \u201cbreakdown\u201d of frontal activation instead of a compensatory increase. In order to draw any further conclusion it would be helpful to study the activation of these regions in elderly people taking also into account their individual task performance (e.g., accuracy). However, only three studies selected for the meta-analysis specifically included older populations; thus, the age-range was clearly undersampled in the current meta-analysis and the power to reliably assess the influence of age was too low. This might also explain why our results do not seem to be in line with the HAROLD model. Therefore, more empirical data comparing older and younger populations are necessary in order to find out more about specific age differences in activation during vWM. A better understanding of these age-related differences would pave the way for creating more sophisticated methods to preserve or enhance cognitive function in elderly populations. \n\nH\u00f6ller-Wallscheid et al. ( ) hypothesized the decreased lateralization across the PFC to be independent of age, but to depend on the subjective difficulty of WM tasks. In line with this hypothesis we found a bilateral activation across the PFC in the load effect meta-analysis. Our results are also in accordance with the load effect meta-analysis performed by Rottschy et al. ( ). The CRUNCH model states that the extent of cortical activation depends on the task load. Our results support this model, since we found a positive correlation between activation in several cortical regions (e.g., frontal areas) and task load. Apart from PFC areas we also found activation in the parietal cortex (IPG and left SPG) to be influenced by load, as reported in a previous study by Braver et al. ( ). Likewise, activation of the right lobule VI and crus I of the cerebellum turned out to depend on the difficulty of the vWM tasks. This is in accordance with a previous study which showed these parts of the cerebellum to respond to changes in vWM load (Kirschen et al.,  ). As stated before, there are anatomical connections between these parts of the cerebellum and frontal areas. Hence, the increased input from frontal regions involved in the articulatory system during a load manipulation could also reflect the increased activation of the right cerebellum. In addition, we found an association between load and activation in the fusiform gyrus. Tsapkini and Rapp ( ) pointed out that lesions of the left fusiform gyrus were significantly associated with reading and spelling deficits. In light of this finding, the positive correlation between load and activation in the left fusiform gyrus in the present study might indicate that a majority of people may have used overt rehearsal as a strategy to cope with increasing task difficulty. \n\nIt has long been recognized that RT is sensitive to manipulations of any kind of WM load (Just and Carpenter,  ). Therefore, RT can also be viewed as a measure of load. A previous study found a significant positive correlation between RT and fMRI signal in nine subjects in the MFG and the left IFG (Braver et al.,  ). The present meta-analysis partially corroborates these findings showing both the left MFG and the left precentral gyrus to be positively associated with RT. However, our results seem to contradict a study by Honey et al. ( ), which reported that posterior parietal cortical activation was predicted by a prolonged RT in a vWM task. Importantly though, as states earlier, activation in the parietal cortex is influenced by load, which\u2014in turn is related to RT. Moreover, the present meta-analysis revealed a positive association between left precentral gyrus activation and RT. This finding is plausible considering that the left precentral gyrus constitutes a major part of the primary motor area and its activation is contralateral to the side of the hand movement. Hence, increased activation in the primary motor cortex might facilitate faster responding. It should be emphasized that RT information was not available for all studies. Moreover, RT depends on many other factors such as number of responses alternatives, type of discrimination or delay time. Therefore, results of this factor should be treated with caution. \n\nAlthough we performed a meta-analysis in which only fMRI studies were included, there has been a previous meta-analysis in which they selected both fMRI and PET studies to isolate the neural correlates of human working memory (Wager and Smith,  ). Although they found some support for left frontal cortex dominance in vWM tasks, this was only for tasks with low executive demand. These results support our finding regarding the lateralization, i.e., the higher the difficulty on the task, the less lateralization of PFC activation is to be expected. \n\nFinally, we expected the type of fMRI paradigm to be a significant moderator as demonstrated in a previous meta-analysis (Rottschy et al.,  ). This expectation was not met by the data. This could be due to a strong overlap in task activation, with potentially existing subtle quantity differences being too weak to be significant. We also found that gender did not affect activation associated with vWM tasks. However, we cannot exclude that gender differences would emerge when controlling for effects of sex hormones. Hence, future studies are required that carefully consider these potentially confounding factors. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nIn the present meta-analysis we discussed a number of relevant networks based on fMRI activity, such as the attentional system, but we did not take into account brain connectivity. However, the localization of brain areas is just the first step toward a more comprehensive understanding of the neural correlates of vWM. Analyses based on temporal dynamics, such as EEG or single-unit recordings, are essential to build a more integrative view. Another limitation regards our cerebellum findings. There is strong reason to assume that we did not find any inferior cerebellum activation because some of the scans included in the present meta-analysis did not cover the whole cerebellum due to methodological limitations (e.g., trade-off between brain coverage and repetition time). \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nWe used a coordinate-based meta-analysis to integrate the current literature on vWM in healthy humans. We found activation of the established fronto-parietal network and the right cerebellum, especially crus I, and lobule VI. Our results support the dual-selection model, according to which a mid-lateral PFC activation occurs due to verbal input. Moreover, our results illustrate that we should not underestimate the activation of subcortical regions that play an important role for response inhibition. Age, mean RT, and load moderate vWM task activation and, thus, should be taken into consideration in future research. Especially the influencing factor of age should be further analyzed since the sample included in the present meta-analysis consists of primarily young people. Mean reaction time, moreover, could be influenced by many other factors. Further, more fine-grained studies are needed to gain a better understanding of the neural correlates underlying processes involved in vWM including encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nME, CB, and KK contributed to the conception and design of the study.

Among these, five studies with a total of 98 cognitively normal older participants (mean age: 69.5 years) were included. The meta-analysis yielded two clusters. Main activations were found in the right insula, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Despite the limited number of studies included, our meta-analysis highlights the crucial involvement of circuits associated with both emotion regulation and the decision to act. However, in contrast to the literature on young adults, our results indicate a different pattern of hemispheric lateralization in older participants. These activations can be used as a minimum pattern of activation in the risky decision-making tasks of healthy older subjects. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Introduction \n  \nDecision making is a complex cognitive phenomenon that is important and commonly used in everyday life situations. Because older people are at increased risk of developing severe pathologies that impact their functional independence, they have to face more decision-making situations [ ]. These decisions concern, for example, consent to a specific treatment. However, it can also involve complex choices, such as moving from their home to a facility better adapted to their health condition. This type of decision making is a dynamic process that involves a balance between risk-taking, the preservation of independence and safety. However, through accumulated experience, older people also have the ability to use a range of experiences to support their decision making [ , , ]. \n\nDecision making refers to a process that includes several steps, from analyzing a problem, to taking action to solve it. In the medical field, the ability to make a decision relies on the ability to provide informed consent [ , , ]. Decision making has been broken down into three cognitive stages: (i) option generation, (ii) option evaluation, and (iii) launching the action [ , ]. In addition to mobilizing the sensory functions necessary for communication and language skills involved in the integration of information, decision making involves complex neuropsychological processes. Indeed, decision making is largely part of executive functioning and involves other processes such as flexibility, inhibition, working memory and emotion recognition. \n\nNeuropsychological tests that assess risky decision making typically use two types of conditions: (1) decisions \u201cunder ambiguity\u201d, where the probability associated with each outcome is unknown, and (2) decisions \u201cunder risk\u201d, where the rule of attribution and occurrence of an event is known [ ]. Risk preferences often differ depending on whether people make choices based on described probabilities, versus direct experience of the odds and outcomes in behavioral tasks [ ]. In decisions based on experience, which are closest to the real-life decision, the most frequently used behavioral test is the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which is generally recognized as a decision-under-ambiguity task [ ]. Other related behavioral tests include the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) [ ] and the Game of Dice Task (GDT) [ ]. Computerized versions of those behavioral tasks have been adapted and are widely used in the literature. Nevertheless, the classification allowing the distinction between \u201cunder ambiguity\u201d and \u201cunder risk\u201d is based on the main period of interest analyzed. Indeed, in the IGT and BART, the principle is that there are classically two phases in these tasks, associated with a learning curve. Initially, the participant explores strategies corresponding to \u201cunder-ambiguity\u201d experimentation. In a second phase, the participant has understood which strategies are advantageous or not, switching to a model called \u201cunder-risk\u201d. However, the BART involves much more risk taking and impulsivity. Indeed, the participant has direct feedback on his/her strategy (explosion or gain) and can adapt his/her risk-taking accordingly for the following trials [ ]. However, in the IGT, the participant tries to understand the winning strategy, which is not explicit [ ]. In the GDT, on the other hand, the consequences of choices are explicitly given in advance. Consequently, the GDT is an exclusive decision-making task under risk, without learning by feedback. These tests have been used in numerous studies in both healthy young and older populations, as well as in clinical populations (with psychiatric disorders, in particular) [ , , ]. These studies have shown qualitative and quantitative differences in behavioral strategies in these tasks as a function of age, the presence of neurological lesions and/or neuropsychiatric pathologies. \n\nThere is evidence that decision-making processes can be affected over the course of normal aging, especially when decisions must be taken quickly, and that this may be due to an underlying decline in processing speed [ , ]. A decline in executive functioning in aging such as increased perseverative behavior may also be associated with risky decision-making impairment. Thus, when faced with new and unfamiliar situations, older adults take more time to analyze the situation than younger ones. This has been observed during decision-making tests in situations where the outcomes and consequences are unknown, such as the first phase of the IGT or BART [ ]. On the other hand, in a previous meta-analysis, it was noted that, in behaviorally risky decision-making tasks, the need for learning had an impact on the choice strategy in aging compared to younger subjects [ ]. As soon as the rules become clear, i.e., in the \u201cunder-risk\u201d final phases of behavioral tasks, however, this difference between younger and older healthy adults disappears. Thus, when older adults are given enough time or when they can rely on past experiences, decision-making function remains preserved pp. 351\u2013370 in [ , ]. Furthermore, the decision-making processes involved in these tests include executive functions, but also motivation and reward processes. In general, tests tend to show that aging is associated with a change in strategy; a reduction or prevention of losses is favored over the optimization of gains. Choices resulting from this shift are influenced by the individual motivation profile in each situation. These data are also found in ecological and neuro-economic analyses [ ]. \n\nThe development of functional neuroimaging has gradually allowed the exploration of the neurofunctional bases of these behaviors. However, studies on decision making have been carried out mainly in healthy young adults. In this specific population, several meta-analyses have been performed [ , , ]. Results have mainly shown activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) [ ], especially in sub-risk decision-making situations (which are most similar to complex real-life decision-making situations), followed by the activation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the insula [ ]. In recent years, studies comparing young versus older healthy participants have shown inconsistent results in terms of patterns of activation, which may depend on the types of tasks used. As such, healthy older subjects are reported to have greater contralateral activation in prefrontal and insular regions compared to young adults [ , ], while other authors have described an age-related increase in right ventro-medial prefrontal cortex activity [ , ]. Nevertheless, although the use of neuroimaging techniques to study decision-making abilities associated with aging is growing rapidly, there are many fewer studies with this population than with younger adults, and the results are still sometimes ambiguous and difficult to interpret. \n\nThus, it seemed important at this stage to determine, based on these data, if there was a common pattern of functional activation related to experience-based decision making in risky situations in normal aging emerging from these studies. The purpose of our study was to carry out a meta-analysis on the neural networks underlying risky decision making in healthy older adults. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \nThis meta-analysis was conducted following the guidelines from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [ ]. The details of the method are explained below: \n\n### 2.1. Criteria for Inclusion \n  \nParticipants: We included only studies that included healthy older participants. To target an aging population, and to ensure that we did not miss any relevant studies, we included studies with a minimal inclusion age of 55 years. This is typically the minimum age for the inclusion of older participants. \n\nfMRI: Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI (fMRI) measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow, which creates what is referred to as a blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Thus, Voxel-Based Morphometry analyses in anatomical MRI were not considered. Diffusion and resting state data were also not included. \n\nDecision-making tasks in risky situations: This corresponds to both \u201csub-ambiguity\u201d and \u201cunder risk\u201d behavioral tasks, as well as mixed decision-making neuropsychological tests. As such, we narrowed our inclusions to widely used and replicated tasks such as the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), the Game of Dice Task (GDT) and the Iowa Gambling task (IGT). \n\n\n### 2.2. Search Strategy \n  \nWe searched for publications specifically evaluating decision making in older adults. Databases of peer-reviewed literature were systematically searched on PubMed and EMBASE for manuscripts in the English language published up to December 2020. \n\nThe primary search term was as follows: (aged or older or elder or elderly or geriatrics or senior or adults or adult) AND (fMRI or \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d or \u201cfunctional neuroimaging\u201d or \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d) AND (\u201cDecision-making\u201d or \u201cDecision making\u201d) AND (\u201cIowa Gambling Task\u201d OR IGT or \u201cGame of Dice Task\u201d or GDT OR \u201cBalloon Analogue Risk task\u201d OR BART). \n\nThis search yielded 620 articles. The titles and abstracts were reviewed to refine the number of potentially relevant articles. All the articles in which the abstract did not specifically mention the age of the participants, or the nature of neuropsychological tests (risk-based decision-making test), were fully reviewed. Following this step, the inclusion criteria were assessed for each study by carefully reading the Methods and Results sections of each article. \n\nAs a final step, if an article met the search criteria, at this stage, all the references were examined one by one by the authors and the articles were screened using \u201cConnectedpaper.com\u201d algorithms, to make sure that no study had been omitted. \n\nWithin the selected articles, the data extracted included the age of the subjects, level of education, global cognitive assessment, type of decision-making test and coordinates of hyperactivation peaks in the decision-making phase. Among the data analyzed in fMRI, as we were interested in the decision-making phase and not reward-based neurological processes, data associated with reward times were excluded. \n\n\n### 2.3. Statistical Analysis \n  \nAll the studies included in the systematic review were also assessed for a meta-analysis after a quality check with the Covidence Quality Assessment Template. To be included in the meta-analysis, studies had to report (i) specific peaks of foci of activation in either Talairach or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and (ii) peak activation coordinates of whole-brain analyses (could not employ only region of interest, ROI, analyses). \n\nTo perform quantitative meta-analysis, we used the revised version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm [ , ] which treats foci as 3-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions centered at the given coordinates. \n\nBased on these recommendations, to correct for multiple comparisons, a cluster-level family-wise error (cFWE) at   p   < 0.05 was applied using uncorrected   p   < 0.001 at the voxel level as the cluster-forming threshold (based on 1000 permutations). \n\nTo perform ALE meta-analysis, we used specialized software (GingerALE v.3.2.0) to combine the activation coordinates from several studies [ ]. All the peak voxel coordinates were reported in MNI space. For consistency, peak voxels reported in Talairach space in primary studies were converted into MNI space, and the ALE results were displayed onto the MNI brain template using the Mango software package. \n\nThe performance of a meta-analysis requires some vigilance in the case of small numbers of included studies [ ]. In our study, we distinguish significant results as clusters from non-significant peaks. To avoid biases, only cluster results will be detailed and discussed. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Study Selection \n  \nA total of 620 references were selected for initial screening, and, among them, 136 duplicates were removed. As such, the titles and abstracts of 484 studies were screened. After this first screening, 60 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility. Finally, after careful analyses, 55 studies were excluded. The main reasons for exclusion were as follows: 37 were excluded for \u201cnon-target population\u201d (subjects younger than our criteria), 15 for non-target study design (no risky decision-making tests) and three for non-target outcome (ROI analysis and connectivity). As a result, only five studies fully satisfied all the criteria including passing quality checking and were included for meta-analysis [ , , , , ]. A flow chart is shown in  . \n\nThese five studies included a total of 98 healthy subjects aged from 58 to 95, with a mean age 69.5 years, and were cognitively normal. The behavioral tests used were the BART in one publication, the GDT in one other and the IGT in the three remaining studies. All the study characteristics and behavioral results are summarized in  . Some studies included only healthy older adults, another compared healthy and Parkinson Disease older adults and another compared younger and older adults. The five studies came from different teams. \n\nConcerning the paradigms used, for GDT, Labbuda and al. [ ] used an adapted paradigm with no feedback phase. For the BART task, Yu et al. [ ] used a two-level adaptation of the Lejuez paradigm [ ], with low and high risk using two different colors, but without explaining it to participants. Concerning the three IGT studies included, they are all based on the Bechara initial task adapted by Li for fMRI sessions [ ]. As such, the three paradigms are quite similar, with a four-choice situation. Halfmann and al. [ ] reduced the number of trials to 80. \n\nConcerning the fMRI analysis, only based on the decision phase, our systematic review yielded 22 foci to be analyzed from the 98 participants. \n\n\n### 3.2. Main Clusters \n  \nThe meta-analysis yielded two clusters, with four peaks in the first cluster and two peaks in the second one. The full results are detailed in   and  A,B. \n\nThe first cluster is 16.752 mm , from (12, 0, \u221216) to (58, 42, 34), centered at (38.4, 21.4, 5.3) with four peaks and a max value of 0.0079 ALE, 1.8139492 \u00d7 10  P, 3.57 Z at (38, 20, \u22123). It is located in the right brain hemisphere, with 76.3% sub-lobar activation and 23.7% Frontal Lobe activation. Anatomically, this corresponds to the Lentiform Nucleus (49%), the Insula (17.4%), the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (11.4%), the Middle Frontal Gyrus (10.1%), the Claustrum (4.8%), the Caudate (3.5%) and the Precentral Gyrus (2.6%). In terms of functional areas, these are mainly the Putamen (38.8%), Brodmann area 13 (17.1%), Brodmann area 9 (9.2%), the Lateral Globus Pallidus (8.8%), Brodmann area 47 (5.4%), the Caudate Head (3.5%), Brodmann area 45 (3.5%), Brodmann area 46 (2.5%), Brodmann area 44 (2.1%) and the Medial Globus Pallidus (1.4%). \n\nThis corresponds to activations of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and cortico-basal loops of the motivation and reward circuits including the insula and putamen. \n\nThe second cluster is 11.048 mm , from (\u221244, 10, \u221224) to (\u221214, 48, 8), centered at (\u221227.6, 30.1, \u22129.4) with two peaks and a max value of 0.0114 ALE, 4.2548763 \u00d7 10  P, 4.45 Z at (\u221222, 34, \u221214). It is located in the left-brain hemisphere with 55% sub-lobar activation and 45% Frontal Lobe activation. Anatomically, this corresponds to the Insula (36.7%), the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (30.6%), the Claustrum (15.8%), the Middle Frontal Gyrus (14%) and Extra-Nuclear (1.8%). In terms of functional areas, these are mainly Brodmann area 13 (33.8%), Brodmann area 47 (25.5%), Brodmann area 11 (12.6%) and Brodmann area 45 (5.8%). \n\nThis corresponds to activations of the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the left dlPFC and cortico-basal loops of the motivation and reward circuits. \n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nOur meta-analysis of patterns of neural activation during behavioral risky decision making in healthy older adults showed clusters of activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, as well as in cortico-basal loops. Despite an inclusion criterion >55 years old, the mean age of the study population was 69.5 years with few participants from 55 to 60 and many participants older than 60, up to 95 years old Thus, our study concerned older participants. \n\nThe results of the current meta-analysis are in line with previous findings showing involvement of both dlPFC and cortico-basal loops to support executive functioning and cognitive automatization, as well as involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex and the insulae to support emotion and reward loops. In this regard, these findings are similar to what has been reported in younger healthy adults [ ]. \n\nIndeed, the insula is involved in emotional regulation circuits, particularly in relation to reward circuits and disgust. The activation of the insula could be associated with reduced risk taking and with more conservative behavior, potentially associated with risk avoidance [ ]. \n\nConcerning the inferior frontal gyrus, recent studies have highlighted its importance in working memory and cognitive flexibility in decision making [ ].  \n\nIn our meta-analysis, these activations were found in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, although predominantly in the left hemisphere, classically known for its involvement in the modulation of decision making in reaction to the identification of emotional processes with projections within the insula [ ]. In addition, bilateral activation (although predominantly right) was found in the putamen and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, associated with executive functions, cognitive automatization and the planning of the response in relation to the decision taken [ ]. \n\nIn contrast to young adults, however, results of the current meta-analysis indicate that older adults show a different pattern of functional activation in several regions. In fact, we observed a bilateral, although predominantly right, pattern of activation of the cortico-basal loops. Although our study population does not allow direct comparison with younger subjects, the literature shows that this pattern of activation seems to be predominantly left-sided in young subjects [ ]. \n\nVarious functional neuroimaging studies in cognitive aging have led to the development of models, such as the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD) [ , ] and the Posterior-Anterior Shift in Aging (PASA) theory, trying to explain these modifications seen in aging [ ]. The HAROLD model predicts that aging is associated with the recruitment of additional neural resources in regions contralateral to those seen in younger people in the prefrontal cortex [ , ]. Even though ROI structural imaging studies on risky decision making in aging seem to support the HAROLD model [ ], we were unable to find evidence to confirm any of those models in our meta-analysis. Indeed, the results of the current meta-analysis rather seem to support the view that the pattern of functional activation is contralateral to that found in young adults, rather than bilateral, at least with respect to decision making. \n\nThe set of behavioral tasks included in our meta-analysis are risk-taking decision-making tasks. However, among the five included studies, four used tasks combining decisions under ambiguity and decisions under risk, while the fifth task required only decisions under risk. Although all of these tasks mobilize executive functions, we must remain careful in not over-interpreting the results of our meta-analysis, since the tasks used cognitive processes to varying degrees, namely, impulsivity, learning by feedback and risk taking. This limits the generalizability of our results and warrants the need for further studies on complex decision making to be carried out, especially within the context of aging. \n\nThus, this question of compensation in aging with possible recruitment of additional areas still remains partially unexplained in decision making. In this respect, our meta-analysis is not powerful enough and other studies need to be conducted to be able to better analyze this type of compensation. Although our study was limited in its statistical power, it approached this question in an original way and synthesized the current known data. To be able to really interpret the neurofunctional activation data, a greater homogeneity of the paradigms and protocols of decision-making tasks and fMRI analysis must be sought. Although the paradigms included in our study are not identical, the behavioral approach to risky decision making is similar enough across tasks to warrant analysis. However, paradigm adaptations to age-related vulnerabilities, including simplifications of tasks, are observed, sometimes deviating considerably from the initial behavioral task. On the other hand, the same acquisition, analyzed by several teams, can lead to divergent results [ ]. This necessitates a quality process for future research. Given the lack of standardization, we chose to restrict our meta-analysis to widely used tasks that have been the subject of behavioral analyses reproduced in the literature, to avoid biases related to tasks that would not respect risky decision-making behaviors. This leads our analysis to focus on a small number of studies but favors the comparability of the studies and thus the relevance of the results. It is widely accepted that the more the studies included in a meta-analysis, the better the usability of the results [ ]. However, because of the narrowness of our inclusion criteria and the exploitation of only the results grouped in the form of clusters, without integrating the isolated peaks, we reduced the risk of bias [ ]. We therefore present our results as a minimum activation pattern. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted with caution and confirmed by further studies as the functional research on decision making in older adults grows. \n\nThus, our meta-analysis describes a model of activation in the left OFC, bilateral dlPFC and right insula that can be used as a minimum pattern of activation in the risky decision-making behavioral tasks of healthy older subjects. \n\n\n## 5. Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, our meta-analysis on the neural correlates of risky decision making in normal aging highlights the involvement of circuits associated with both emotion regulation (insula, inferior frontal gyrus and orbito-frontal cortex) and executive function (Putamen and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex).  \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8393360, "text_md5": "1f97f67e88574e30ecb6da59e24eec97", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 87], "journal": [88, 97], "publication_year": [99, 103], "title": [114, 216], "keywords": [230, 271], "abstract": [284, 1841], "body": [1850, 24653]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 34439662, "doi": "10.3390/brainsci11081043", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8393360", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8393360"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8393360\">8393360</a>", "list_title": "PMC8393360  Neural Activation in Risky Decision-Making Tasks in Healthy Older Adults: A Meta-Analysis of fMRI Data"}

The quality of the studies involved was evaluated using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve were calculated using bivariate mixed effects models. A subgroup analysis was also performed to explore the heterogeneity. \n\n Results:   Eighteen studies investigating 1319 patients with musculoskeletal STTs (malignant,   n  =623; benign,   n  =696) were enrolled. Thirteen standard DWI studies using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) showed that the pooled SEN and SPE of ADC were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.77-0.82) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.60-0.67), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) calculated from the SROC curve was 0.806. The subgroup analysis indicated that the percentage of myxoid malignant tumors, magnet strength, study design, and ROI placement were significant factors affecting heterogeneity. Four IVIM studies showed that the AUCs calculated from the SROC curves of the parameters ADC and D were 0.859 and 0.874, respectively. The AUCs for the IVIM parameters pseudo diffusion coefficient (D*) and perfusion fraction (f) calculated from the SROC curve were 0.736 and 0.573, respectively. Two DKI studies showed that the AUCs of the DKI parameter mean kurtosis (MK) were 0.97 and 0.89, respectively. \n\n Conclusion:   The DWI-derived ADC value and the IVIM DWI-derived D value might be accurate tools for discriminating musculoskeletal STTs, especially for non-myxoid SSTs, using more than two b values, with maximal b value ranging from 600 to 800 s/mm , additionally, a high-field strength (3.0 T) optimizes the diagnostic performance. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nSoft tissue tumors (STTs) are a very heterogeneous group of tumors with various presentations, and still pose an important challenge in daily clinical practice  ,  . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently used to characterize and grade soft tissue tumors. Some benign STTs, such as haemangioma and lipoma, have characteristic imaging features that can be correctly diagnosed with conventional MRI. However, for a large number of STTs with a nonspecific imaging appearance, conventional MRI is often not reliable for distinguishing malignant from benign soft tissue tumors  - . \n\nIn recent years, some studies have reported the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for benign and malignant STTs. DWI is a technique that is useful for qualitative and quantitative assessments of the motion of water in the tissue microenvironment  - . The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a numerical parameter that is calculated from DWI. According to some investigators, malignant STTs usually have lower ADC values due to increased tumor cell packing  ,  , and the ADC values for myxoid tumors were significantly higher than those of non-myxoid tumors  ,  . Other investigators reported overlapping ADC values for benign and malignant STTs  . However, ADC can be influenced not only by molecular diffusion restriction but also by capillary perfusion effects, therefore, ADC might have a limitation in characterizing the lesion  ,  . Currently, intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) DWI has proposed by Le Bihan  , more accurately separates molecular diffusion and capillary perfusion effects in each voxel and therefore encompasses both the capillary perfusion-related parameter pseudo diffusion coefficient (D*), perfusion fraction (f), and the true molecular diffusion coefficient (D)  ,  ,  . Although several studies have demonstrated the use of IVIM DWI for the differentiation benign and malignant tumors of pancreas, liver, and breast  - , little information is available regarding the usefulness of IVIM parameters for evaluation of musculoskeletal STTs. \n\nConventional DWI techniques always assume a Gaussian diffusion in which water molecules diffuse without any restriction. However, due to the complexity of complex biological tissues, the diffusion of water molecules tends to deviate from a Gaussian distribution, thereby limiting the effectiveness of conventional DWI. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an advanced non-Gaussian diffusion imaging technique that has been used to account for this deficiency and is more suitable for assessments of the tumor microenvironment  - . Previous studies have introduced the feasibility of DKI in brain, rectal, prostate, and breast tumors. However, few DKI studies have examined musculoskeletal STTs  . \n\nPrevious studies were inconclusive because of insufficient samples, different histological tumor types and the use of different diagnostic algorithms, including b values, cut-off values, and MRI parameters  ,  ,  ,  . We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of the diagnostic performance of standard DWI, IVIM DWI, and DKI, for differentiating benign and malignant musculoskeletal STTs. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Search strategy \n  \nWe performed this meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews-Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines  . A search of PubMed, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), Embase, PMC  ,   China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WANFANG databases from their inception until September 2020 was performed to find potentially qualified studies. Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms, keywords, or words appearing were used as the search strategy (S1). We did not impose language restrictions. \n\n\n### Inclusion Criteria and Study Selection \n  \n#### Type of studies \n  \nThe inclusion criteria were (1) cohort studies that included retrospective or prospective studies; (2) the sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) of DWI for distinguishing benign and malignant STTs were reported clearly in the study; and (3) sufficient information was available for calculating true-positive (TP), false-positive (FP), false-negative (FN), and true-negative (TN) values for the statistical analysis. \n\nThe exclusion criteria were (1) studies that were reviews, case reports or case series, abstracts, letters, comments, editorials, or animal studies and (2) studies that had insufficient data for reconstructing 2 2 tables. \n\n\n#### Type of patients \n  \nPatients with known musculoskeletal STTs who were referred for the initial lesion evaluation and had no history of treatment were included, all studies confirmed by histopathology, and excluded lipomatous tumors or vascular tumors. \n\n\n#### Type of imaging technique \n  \nAll studies used DWI, and ADC, DTI, DKI or IVIM parameters were calculated as the index test for differentiating benign and malignant STTs. The studies used other imaging techniques or used the DWI technique but did not pertain to the field of musculoskeletal STTs were excluded. \n\n\n\n### Data Extraction \n  \nA data extraction spreadsheet was developed to collect all related information, then we summarized the information in table of baseline characteristics, imaging characteristics and diagnostic results. \n\n#### Diagnostic results \n  \nThe key information we extracted was the numbers of TP, FP, FN and TN using the DWI-derived parameter ADC; the IVIM DWI-derived parameters D, D*, and f; and the DKI-derived parameter mean kurtosis (MK) compared with histopathology. If TP, FP, TN, and FN were not reported, we calculated these values backwards using the indexes SEN, SPE, and number of malignant and benign lesions, and the results were rounded to the nearest whole number. For studies that reported multiple SEN and SPE due to the use of different combinations of b values, cut-off values, tumor pathologies, or different ROI placements, we extracted all the results. When studies included DWI and other MRI techniques, we only extracted the DWI data. When a study reported multiple histological classifications of STTs, we only extracted the data for benign and malignant tumors, as well as all soft tissue tumors (all STTs) and non-myxoid soft tissue tumors (non-myxoid STTs). When studies reported different ADC measurements, we only extracted the data for the minimal ADC value (ADC ) and mean ADC value (ADC ). When studies had two readers, we extracted the reader with higher accuracy. \n\nOther diagnostic results included the cut-off values, area under the curve (AUC), mean ADC, D, D*, f, and MK for benign and malignant STTs. \n\n\n#### Basic study information \n  \nWe extracted the following information: first author, date of publication, patient age, sex, number of patients, number of benign and malignant STTs, type of tumors (STTs or non-myxoid STTs), reference standard and type of study design (prospective or retrospective). \n\n\n#### Basic Imaging information \n  \nWe extracted the following information: (1) imaging parameters used for DWI (magnetic field strength, MRI machine and vendor, coil used, b values, slice thickness, sequence type, repetition time/echo time (TR/TE), matrix size, and field of view (FOV)); (2) ADC measurements (ADC  and ADC ); and (3) region of interest (ROI) placement (manually over the solid portion or other). \n\n\n\n### Data Quality Assessment \n  \nTwo reviewers independently assessed each study for quality and potential bias using the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies, revised version)  , which mainly consisted of 4 domains: (1) patient selection, (2) index test, (3) reference standard, and (4) flow and timing. When 5 or more than 5 terms were regarded as low risk, the study was classified as high quality. More than 70% of all included studies were high quality, and the quality of all included studies was regarded as high. Disagreements were reviewed in detail and subsequently settled by consensus. \n\n\n### Statistical analysis \n  \nFirst, patient demographic characteristics and extracted covariates were summarized using standard descriptive statistics. Continuous variables are presented as the means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), whereas categorical variables are presented as frequencies or percentages. \n\nSecond, the statistical analyses were performed using Meta-Disc 1.4 software (Ram\u00f3n y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain). Meta-analyses of standard DWI and IVIM DWI were performed as described below. First, heterogeneity between the included studies was evaluated. We evaluated the threshold effect by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient between the logit of SEN and the logit of (1- SPE). The threshold effect was confirmed if the coefficient was >0.6  . Apart from variations due to the threshold effect, heterogeneity might be generated from other related factors. Then, heterogeneity was determined using the Cochran Q test (  P  <0.05 indicating the presence of heterogeneity) and the   I   test (with   I  \u226425% indicating low heterogeneity, 25%<  I  \u226450% indicating moderate heterogeneity, and   I  >50% indicating significant heterogeneity)  ,  . The SEN, and SPE of the included studies were pooled. According to the Cochrane review guidelines, if significant heterogeneity was present at   I   > 50%, random-effects models were chosen; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. We also calculated the AUC of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC). In general, a diagnostic tool is regarded as failed when AUC values range from 0.5 to 0.6, poor when AUC values range from 0.6 to 0.7, fair when AUC values range from 0.7 to 0.8, good when AUC values range from 0.8 to 0.9, and excellent when AUC values range from 0.9 to 1  ,  . \n\nThird, if significant heterogeneity was detected, we then performed meta-regression analyses, setting   P   < 0.05 to indicate a significant contribution to heterogeneity. Subgroups based on (1) ADC measurements (ADC  versus the ADC ); (2) the number of b values (=2 versus >2); (3) maximal b value (b \u2264600 s/mm  versus 600 s/mm <b  \u2264800 s/mm  versus b >800 s/mm ); (4) magnet strength (3.0 T versus 1.5 T); (5) study design (prospective versus retrospective); (6) total number of patients (>60 versus \u226460); (7) ROI placement (manually over solid portion versus other); (8) tumor pathology (all soft tissue tumors versus non-myxoid soft tissue tumors); and (9) percentage of myxoid malignant tumors (>10% versus \u226410%) were analysed. \n\nLast, due to the small sample size of the DKI studies, we did not perform a statistical analysis of the two studies and instead summarized their basic characteristics. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Literature research \n  \n Figure    shows a flow diagram summarizing the literature search process. Ultimately, 18 studies  ,  ,  ,  ,  -  that met the eligibility criteria were included in our meta-analysis (13 studies evaluated standard DWI, 3 studies evaluated IVIM DWI, 1 study evaluated both IVIM and DKI, and 1 study evaluated DKI). \n\n\n### Study characteristics \n  \n#### Patient characteristic \n  \nUltimately, 18 studies examining 1319 patients with musculoskeletal STTs (malignant,   n  =623; benign,   n  =696) were included in this meta-analysis, which excluded lipomatous tumors and vascular tumors.   Table    provides an overview of the patient characteristics in the 18 eligible studies. We obtained 27 diagnostic results of standard DWI, 6 (22.2%) diagnostic results of IVIM DWI, and 2 (7.4%) diagnostic results of DKI for malignant and benign STTs. \n\n\n#### Imaging characteristic \n  \n Table    provides an overview of the MRI characteristics reported in the 18 eligible studies. The MR examinations were performed on a 1.5 T scanner in 8 (44.4%) studies and a 3.0 T scanner in 10 (55.6%) studies, which evaluated the diagnostic performance of DWI with b values ranging from 2 to 10. ADC maps were generated from DWI in the maximal b-value ranging from 300 s/mm  to 2100 s/mm . Seven (38.9%) studies used ADC  as the differentiation criterion with a cut-off value ranging from 0.8-1.9, and 11 (61.1%) studies used ADC  as the differentiation criterion with a cut-off value ranging from 1.09-1.6. Three (16.7%) studies with IVIM DWI used all four IVIM parameters, including ADC, D, D*, and f, and 1 (5.56%) study only used two IVIM parameters, including ADC and D. Two (11.1%) studies reporting DKI used MK. In addition, 3 (16.7%) studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of ADC combined with conventional MRI. \n\n\n\n### Quality of included studies \n  \nSixteen (88.9%) of the 18 included studies with 5 or more than 5 terms were regarded as low risk, and they were finally regarded as high quality; as a result, the quality of all studies was high. The detailed results for the QUADAS-2 scores for every study can be found in   Figure   . \n\nIn the patient selection domain, 1 (5.6%) study did not clearly describe the methods for patient selection, and 4 (22.2%) studies did not clearly report inappropriate exclusion. In the index test domain, 6 (33.3%) studies did not clearly report the threshold used, and 2 (11.1%) studies did not clearly report the blinding of the reference standard from MRI results. For the reference test domain, 4 (22.2%) studies were unclear, as no information was provided on whether the radiologists were blinded to the reference standard. For the flow and timing domain, 1 (5.6%) study was unclear because the time interval between MRI and the reference standard was not reported. \n\n\n### Diagnostic Performance of Quantitative Assessment of standard DWI \n  \nThe diagnostic results of standard DWI for benign and malignant STTs are shown in   Table   . A large range of mean ADC values for malignant (0.74-1.58 10  mm /s), and benign lesions (0.97-1.92 10  mm /s) was reported. The SEN and SPE of the included diagnostic results ranged from 0.53 to 1.0 and from 0.30 to 0.95, respectively. The threshold effect was absent since the corresponding correlation coefficient was 0.047 between the logit of SEN and the logit of (1-SPE). The pooled SEN and SPE were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.77-0.82) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.60-0.67), respectively. The forest plots are shown in   Figure   . The Q test indicated the presence of heterogeneity (Q=45.07;   p  =0.01), and the   I   value of 42.3% revealed moderate heterogeneity. However, SEN (  I  =63.9%) and SPE (  I  =80.2%) indicated significant heterogeneity. The DOR was 8.61 (95% CI 6.93-10.72). The AUC was 0.806, and the SROC curve is shown in   Figure   . The results revealed the good diagnostic performance of ADC derived from DWI in differentiating benign and malignant STTs. When combined with conventional MRI in 3 studies  ,  ,  , the AUCs increased to 0.97, 0.66, and 0.91, and the AUC of the SROC curve was 0.99, indicating perfect diagnostic performance. \n\n#### Meta-regression and subgroup analyses \n  \nWe next carried out meta-regression and subgroup analyses to explore the possible sources of heterogeneity, and the results of meta-regression and subgroup analyses are summarized in   Table   . Among the covariates that were considered a potential source of heterogeneity for sensitivity, the percentage of myxoid malignant tumors (  P  =0.041), magnet strength (  P   =0.019), study design (  P   =0.00), and ROI placement (  P   =0.018) were significant factors. Specifically, retrospective studies, studies that included myxoid malignant tumors less than 10%, studies that used a magnet strength of 3.0 T, and studies in which the ROI was not manually placed over the solid portion of the tumor reported higher SEN, SPE, DOR, and AUC values than the other subgroups. \n\nThe other factors, including the ADC measurements, number of b values, maximal b value, total number of patients, and pathology of the tumor, were insignificantly contributors to the heterogeneity. However, studies that only included non-myxoid tumors, studies that chose maximal b values ranging from 600 to 800 s/mm , and studies that included more than 2 b values also reported slightly higher SEN, SPE, DOR, and AUC values. \n\n\n\n### Diagnostic Performance of Quantitative Assessment of IVIM-DWI \n  \n Table    shows the diagnostic results of IVIM DWI for benign and malignant STTs. A large range of mean ADC, D, D\u2217, and f values was reported. The threshold effect was observed for parameters ADC and D, since the correlation coefficients between the logit of SEN and the logit of (1-SPE) were 0.771 and 0.771, respectively, and the areas under the SROC curves (AUCs) were 0.859 and 0.874, respectively (shown in   Figure   ). The Q test indicated the absence of heterogeneity (Q=2.07,   P  =0.839; Q=1.06,   P  =0.957; respectively) and the SEN (  I  =47.5% and 41.8%, respectively) and SPE (  I  =39.2%, 0%, respectively) exhibited moderate heterogeneity. The results revealed the good diagnostic performance of ADC and D derived from IVIM in differentiating benign and malignant STTs. \n\nHowever, the threshold effect was absent for the parameters D* and f, since the correlation coefficients were -0.30 and 0.40, respectively. The Q test exhibited no significant heterogeneity (Q=7.29,   P  =0.12; Q=3.58,   P  =0.46; respectively). However, the pooled SEN was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.58-0.76) and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.43-0.61), the SPE was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.59-0.75) and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.59-0.74), and the AUCs were 0.736 and 0.573, respectively. The results were lower than other parameters and may indicate a failed-to-fair diagnostic performance in differentiating benign and malignant STTs. \n\n\n### Diagnostic Performance of Quantitative Assessment of DKI \n  \nTwo studies with DKI used the parameter MK. One study chose 4 values for the diffusion factor b (0, 1000, 1500, and 2000 s/mm ) in combination for diagnosis. The mean (\u00b1SD) MK values were 0.49 \u00b1 0.17 and 1.14 \u00b1 0.30 for benign and malignant tumors, respectively. At a cut-off of MK = 0.81, the SPE and SEN for the diagnosis of malignant tumors were 96.3 and 93.8%, respectively. The AUC was 0.97 for MK. Another study chose 5 values for the diffusion factor b (0, 100, 700, 1400 and 2000 s/mm ) in combination for diagnosis. The mean (\u00b1SD) MK values were 0.45 \u00b1 0.97 and 0.82 \u00b1 0.56 for benign and malignant tumors, respectively. At a cut-off of MK = 0.60, the SPE and SEN for the diagnosis of malignant tumors were 60 and 100%, respectively. The AUC was 0.89 for MK. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, our meta-analysis is the first to systematically compare all relevant standard DWI, IVIM DWI and advanced non-Gaussian diffusion techniques for DKI to evaluate the diagnostic performance in distinguishing benign and malignant musculoskeletal STTs. According to our search, few reviews pertain to musculoskeletal STTs. The aims of these reviews are divided into two types: one was to analyze DWI findings of different histological types of tumors and to compare the ADC values acquired, and the other was to review the various techniques of DWI acquisition and the utility of qualitative and quantitative methods of image interpretation, with an emphasis on optimal methods for ADC measurement  ,  - . There was only one meta-analysis evaluated the diagnostic potential of ADC values obtained from standard DWI in distinguishing malignant and benign STTs, which was estimated by the standard mean difference (SMD)  . \n\nThe results of our meta-analysis revealed that standard DWI displays good diagnostic performance for discriminating between benign and malignant musculoskeletal STTs. However, a number of heterogeneities between studies of ADC need further consideration. By performing a meta-regression analysis, DWI performed at higher field strengths using 3.0 T MR systems was more effective than DWI performed using a 1.5 T system because the signal-to-noise ratio is influenced by the strength of the magnetic field, with higher fields producing a better signal-to-noise ratio and therefore a better quality of MRI for accurately drawing an ROI of the tumor  ,  . The difference in the locations of ROIs also led to heterogeneity. Jeon, JY et al   reported that the AUCs of both ADC values extracted from the solid portion and whole tumor were nearly identical, but the ADC values extracted from the solid portion exhibited better diagnostic accuracy but lower sensitivity. The results of the subgroup analysis conducted in our study did not contradict this conclusion. Our study reported that setting the ROIs manually in the solid portion to extract ADC values had a lower AUC and sensitivity, which may make the ADCs unavailable to systematically clarify the characteristics and heterogeneity , but this result was not reliable, because of the unstandardized technique, further studies will be needed to clarify the accuracy of this conclusion. The percentage of myxoid malignant STTs in every study might also be an important source of heterogeneity. Myxoid components of STTs are a potential source of inconsistency in the discrimination of malignant STTs from benign STTs, and significantly higher ADC values have been observed in myxoid-containing lesions  ,  ,  , which may decrease the accuracy of ADC. Therefore, in our results, compared with the subgroup with a percentage of myxoid malignant tumors greater than 10%, the less than 10% subgroup showed a better diagnostic performance with a higher AUC and SEN values. \n\nBy other subgroup analysis, we found that maximal b value (600<b\u2264800), the number of b value (>2), pathology of tumor (non-myxoid tumor) and the ADC measurement were insignificantly contributed to the heterogeneity, but also have clinical diagnosis value, and probably affect test performance. The use of a higher b value for DWI scans has been suggested to result in ADC values with a lower effect of blood perfusion and a better response to the diffusion of water molecules within the tissue  , and the use of more b values might achieve better separation. Although the use of at least three values ranging from 150-900 mm /s was advocated in the Consensus Conference held in Toronto in 2008  , the optimal number and scale of b value are still controversial  ,  , and our results may provide reference values for clinical applications to some extent. In the subgroup analysis, the best results were obtained from the study group in which the tumor pathology was non-myxoid tumors, with an AUC of 0.94. As mentioned above, ADC values for the percentage of myxoid malignant tumors may be affected by the myxoid matrix within the tumor, which makes a radiological diagnosis based on ADC values alone quite difficult  ,  . However, most myxoid tumors have suggestive characteristics on conventional MRI, appearing as \u201cfluid-like\u201d lesions with very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and variable enhancement after gadolinium injection  ,  . Thus, the combination of these techniques in conventional MRI may lead to fewer misdiagnoses. As shown in our meta-analysis, 3 studies  ,  ,   analysed the diagnostic performance of DWI combined with conventional MRI, and the AUC of the SROC curve was 0.99, which was significantly higher than DWI alone and indicated perfect diagnostic performance. In clinical practice, for tumors with no typical myxoid characteristics according to conventional MRI, the ADC technique can be added to increase the diagnostic SEN. Moreover, no consensus has been reached regarding the most useful ADC measurements. A previous review   reported that the ADC  value had a better diagnostic performance for discriminating STTs because it may provide more insights into the cellular composition, while the ADC  value may be diluted because of myxoid, cystic or fewer cellular regions included in the ROI. In contrast, our study revealed that the pooled SEN, SPE and AUC of both ADC  and ADC  values were nearly identical, which may be important for radiologists when the ADC of DWI is applied in daily clinical practice. \n\nFurthermore, our meta-analysis revealed that IVIM DWI-derived D and ADC values showed good diagnostic performance for differentiating malignant from benign STTs, and D would be slightly better than ADC because D eliminates the contributions of tissue perfusion to reflect tissue diffusivity more precisely than ADC . Our results contradicted a previous study by Wu H and Lee SK et al  ,   showing that the AUCs of ADC were slightly better than those of D based on the ROC analysis. We also noted that the ADC and D values gradually decreased from benign to malignant tumors, in which water molecule diffusion was more impeded due to the increase in cell density and decrease in the extracellular space  ,  ,  . However, IVIM-derived D* and f failed to show fair diagnostic performance. D* is considered proportional to the mean capillary segment length and average blood velocity and may chiefly reflect tumor vascularity  ,   Although our results showed a distinct increase in D* from benign to malignant soft tissue tumors, the diagnostic performance was fair. The f value may correlate with the amount of normal angiogenesis with intact vessels in terms of basement membrane thickness and pericyte coverage and may be an indicator of intact vascular permeability. Perhaps due to variability in histological grades or varying tumor vascularity among the tumor types  ,  , the diagnostic performance of the f value was poor. Further studies with larger numbers of subjects are needed to confirm our findings. \n\nAccording to previous studies, DKI parameters are sensitive to noise effects and the degradation of image quality that strongly influence nonbrain imaging, and the reliability may be insufficient, especially for nonbrain imaging  ,  . Few DKI studies on musculoskeletal STTs have been conducted, and we only included 2 studies. They both revealed that the DKI-derived MK parameter showed good diagnostic performance for differentiating malignant from benign STTs, which was presumed to be correlated with the complexity of the tumor microenvironment  . However, the result is inconclusive due to the small number of publications, and these studies did not include patients with myxoid sarcoma or chondrosarcoma. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nOur study has some limitations that cannot be ignored. First, the overrepresentation of a sample may be a limitation of our pooled estimates because we included multiple sensitivities and specificities from the same authors investigating the same population. Second, our study did not include DTI studies. DTI is one of the conventional DWI techniques that evaluate the three-dimensional (3D) motion of protons in tissues, providing quantitative data on the amount and directionality of random movement of water molecules. DTI is a feasible technique that is mainly used to evaluate peripheral nerve tumors and soft tissue tumors arising around nerve structures  ,  . Therefore, these studies did not conform to our study selection criteria. Last, although the possible sources of heterogeneity were explored, the different MRI vendors, sequences, imaging parameters, anatomical locations and tumor physiologies and their potential impacts on conclusions should not be neglected; thus, well-conducted investigations using a standardized methodology are needed to confirm the utility of DWI for discriminating between benign and malignant STTs. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, the DWI-derived ADC value and the IVIM DWI-derived D value might be an accurate tool for discriminating STTs, especially for non-myxoid SSTs; the use of more than two b values, a maximal b value between 600 and 800 s/mm , and high field strength (3.0 T) may optimize the diagnostic performance. The use of DWI combined with conventional MRI might help to improve the diagnostic accuracy. However, more high-quality studies with larger samples are warranted to verify a standardized methodology in clinical practice. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8734420, "text_md5": "23b8ea5c6ca31794806f808e53bb5afc", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 159], "journal": [160, 168], "publication_year": [170, 174], "title": [185, 348], "keywords": [362, 438], "abstract": [451, 2502], "body": [2511, 30411]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 35003360, "doi": "10.7150/jca.62131", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8734420", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8734420"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8734420\">8734420</a>", "list_title": "PMC8734420  Diagnostic Performance of Diffusion MRI for differentiating Benign and Malignant Nonfatty Musculoskeletal Soft Tissue Tumors: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"}

Medications have been introduced to alleviate the craving or reduce the appetite via a neuropharmacological approach. However, the underlying cerebral processing of the medications was largely unknown. This study aimed to meta-analyze existing neuroimaging findings. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify relevant publications. Original studies that reported brain imaging findings using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were initially included. The reported coordinates of brain activation available from the studies were extracted and meta-analyzed with the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach via the software GingerALE. The overall analysis pooling data from 24 studies showed that the right claustrum and insula were the targeted sites of altered cerebral processing of food cues by the medications. Subgroup analysis pooling data from 11 studies showed that these sites had reduced activity levels under medications compared to placebo. The location of this significant cluster partially overlapped with that attributable to affective value processing of food cues in a prior meta-analysis. No brain regions were found to have increased activity levels by medications. These neural correlates may help explain the physiological effect of food consumption by anti-appetite and anti-obesity medications. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## INTRODUCTION \n  \nExcessive food consumption could lead to unwanted health consequences such as weight gain and diabetes. The prevalence of obesity was reported to be around 4 - 36.5% in Europe [ ] and 28.5-32.2% in the United States [ ]. Meanwhile, the global prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 8.8% [ ]. One way to reduce appetite or manage obesity is through pharmacological means. A recent meta-analysis showed that common anti-appetite medications, such as orlistat, phentermine plus topiramate, lorcaserin, naltrexone plus bupropion, and liraglutide could all significantly reduce body weight compared to placebo [ ]. \n\nWith the advancement of neuroimaging methods, the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural correlates of appetite and food perception has become popular. With the accumulated literature, a meta-analysis could pool data across relevant papers to identify brain regions that were consistently reported to be affected by anti-appetite medications. Such a meta-analysis could be performed using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach, which used a probability distribution model [ ,  ] to determine the consistency of activated brain regions reported across multiple experiments. This approach successfully meta-analyzed neuroimaging studies on taste and food stimuli among healthy subjects receiving no pharmacological interventions [ - ]. However, it was largely unknown if the medications exhibited a common pattern in reducing the brain activity level in response to food stimuli that might reflect suppression of appetite or food craving. The aim of this work was to meta-analyze the existing neuroimaging results from pharmacological fMRI studies to reveal which brain regions were commonly targeted by the medications and if these brain regions exhibited a heightened or dampened response to food stimuli. \n\n\n## METHODS \n  \n### Literature Search and Screening \n  \nAdhering to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, papers were searched in multiple databases, namely PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, in May 2021. The following string was used to search for the titles, abstracts, and keywords of papers: (fMRI OR \u201cfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\u201d OR \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d)   AND   (food* OR appetit* OR eat*)   AND   (pharmacol* OR drug* OR medicat* OR treat*). Reference lists of relevant publications were also searched to identify missed papers. \n\nThe search initially yielded 1490 papers. After excluding duplicates, 890 remained. Among them, 866 were excluded after further screening because of being irrelevant, not written in English, no task-related fMRI activation, no coordinates provided, being a single case study, duplicate samples, no significant results, and no results from the whole-brain analysis. Finally, 24 studies remained (Fig.    ). \n\n\n### Information Recorded from the Analyzed Papers \n  \nSeveral items were recorded for each of the analyzed papers, such as subject number, female ratio, subject type (healthy or with specific health issues), medication and control used, administration method, dose, fasting time before the scan, type of food cue, and whether medicated or control condition had larger brain activation (Table    ). \n\n\n### ALE Meta-analysis \n  \nThe ALE method is the commonest approach of coordinate-based meta-analysis that pools neuroimaging data from multiple studies to identify brain regions with consistent activation based on probability distribution modeling [ ]. The standard coordinates of reported brain areas with activation were pooled. Lancaster transform was deployed to convert coordinates reported in the Talairach system to the MNI system [ ]. The software GingerALE 3.0.2 (freely available from  ) was used to perform the ALE meta-analysis, with the following default parameter settings. Subject-based full-width half-maximum values were applied [ ]. The more conservative mask instead of the dilated mask was used. A cluster of brain voxels was considered significantly activated if it survived a cluster   P   < 0.05 (corrected by familywise error rate, FWE-corrected) with a primary cluster-defining threshold of P < 0.001. This threshold followed the latest recommendations to balance between false positive and false negative [ - ]. Three main analyses were performed: an overall analysis involving all data, and one analysis for [medication > control] and [medication < control] each, respectively. As there were multiple (three) studies reporting [oxytocin > control] results, an exploratory analysis was performed based on this contrast. The thresholded ALE maps were overlaid onto the Colin brain template in MNI space [ ] and visualized with Mango 4.0 (freely available from  ) to show results. \n\n\n\n## RESULTS \n  \n### Study Characteristics \n  \nThere were 24 papers entering the meta-analysis, published between 2010 and 2020. The number of participants per study ranged from 8 to 48. Five studies recruited an equal ratio of males and females, whereas six studies recruited females only, and four studies recruited males only (Table    ) [ - ]. Twelve studies recruited healthy subjects only, and numerous studies recruiting subjects with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes. Many medications were investigated, but only oxytocin was investigated in multiple (three) studies. Naltrexone was also involved in three studies, one of which was administered together with buproprion. Overnight or 12 hours of fasting before a scan seemed to be the commonest practice. Besides, 17 studies used visual food cues only. Two studies used taste food cues only, four studies used both visual and taste food cues, and one study used odor. \n\n\n### Overall Meta-analysis \n  \nThere was one significant cluster covering the claustrum and insula on the right hemisphere (Fig.    , Table    ). Seven studies (with no recurring medication shared) contributed to this cluster, four of them had [medication > control] [ ,  - ] and three had [medication < control] [ ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n### Medication > Control \n  \nThere was no significant result from pooled data from 15 studies for [medication > control]. The same was observed for pooled data from 3 studies for [oxytocin > control]. \n\n\n### Medication < Control \n  \nPooling data from 11 studies showed that there was one significant cluster covering the claustrum and insula on the right hemisphere (Fig.    , Table    ). Three studies contributed to this cluster, and they investigated citalopram, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine, and exenatide, respectively [ ,  ,  ]. \n\n\n\n## DISCUSSION \n  \nThis is the first meta-analysis of fMRI studies reporting the effects of medications on food/taste processing in the brain. Overall results showed that the right claustrum and insula were involved by the effect of medications. Results further showed that medications caused reduced brain responses than placebo in the right claustrum and insula, whereas no significant result was found   vice versa  . \n\nTaste processing and eating behavior are complex psychophysiological issues with multiple dimensions. In particular, the five senses of visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, tactile, or any combinations of them could be stimulated. Prior meta-analysis showed that visual food cues activated the posterior brain regions responsible for visual processing, including the occipital and cerebellar structures, whereas gustatory and olfactory food cues activated the anterior brain regions responsible for visceral sensations [ ]. Most of the analyzed studies here recruited visual food cues only, implying that the reduced brain activation by medications could perhaps be cautiously interpreted as a suppressed brain activity in response to viewing food, food anticipation, or even imaging food consumption, but not the actual consumption of food. In fact, food appreciation could involve affective value, intensity, and taste quality, which could be segregated in the limbic system [ ]. The cluster found in this study was located in the ventral insula, a region relevant to taste processing [ ]. It also slightly overlapped with a cluster for affective value but did not overlap with the clusters for intensity and taste quality [ ]. \n\nAnother issue that should be noticed but not addressed in the analyzed studies was the potential influence of sex-related factors on pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. For example, the commonly used naltrexone/bupropion combination might have sex differences in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response, and that oestrogen might potentiate the liver metabolism of bupropion to its active metabolite form [ ]. The analyzed studies did not provide direct between-sex comparison results. They also did not accumulate a large number of uni-sex results for conducting a male   vs  . female meta-analysis. Therefore, any sex differences in the neural correlates of medication-mediated food processing remained to be elucidated. \n\nThere were several limitations of this meta-analysis. First, several studies recruited few subjects that might hinder the study power by themselves. Also, the studies were not always sex-matched, implying that some results reported from the original studies might not be generalized to the other sex. The heterogeneous sample also implied limitations in the generalization of the results. The authors of studies not reporting coordinates were not contacted to see if they could provide data. Many medications were investigated in one or two studies reporting whole-brain analysis results; therefore, it was not possible to perform medication-specific analysis for them. One study [ ] investigated rimonabant, a drug introduced in Europe in 2006 and subsequently withdrawn in 2009 due to the potential of serious psychiatric disorders [ ]. Meanwhile, ALE meta-analysis computes the consistency of brain locations involved across studies but not the effect size [ ]. \n\n\n## CONCLUSION \n  \nWithin the limitations of this meta-analysis, it was concluded that medications could suppress brain activation in the right claustrum and insula in response to food cues (mostly visual) compared to control/placebo. The involved brain region partly overlapped with an activated cluster attributed to affective value evaluation of food in a prior meta-analysis. These neural correlates may help explain the physiological effect of food consumption by anti-appetite and anti-obesity medications and may be the target sites of future drug development. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 9185797, "text_md5": "a40c41da6e657ae826f5e2c9c6f50447", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 19], "journal": [20, 39], "publication_year": [41, 45], "title": [56, 125], "keywords": [139, 204], "abstract": [217, 1664], "body": [1673, 12218]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 34521327, "doi": "10.2174/1570159X19666210914142227", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9185797", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=9185797"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9185797\">9185797</a>", "list_title": "PMC9185797  Neural Correlates of Anti-appetite Medications: An fMRI Meta-analysis"}

NEURAL CORRELATES OF EMOTIONAL PROCESSING IN PSYCHOSIS RISK AND ONSET \u2013 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF FMRI STUDIES\n\n# Keywords\n\n\n\n# Abstract\n \n## Background \n  \nBehavioural findings suggest that the emotion processing abnormalities typically observed in established schizophrenia are already present in patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP). Evidence has been less consistent in people at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHRp). While several studies have reported unaltered behavioural performance on emotion identification in people at CHRp compared to healthy controls, some studies have shown poorer negative emotion recognition. A growing number of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) studies have investigated brain response to emotion processing to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these processes in FEP patients and CHRp individuals. Despite the marked expansion of this field over the last two decades, to date, no systematic review or meta-analysis has attempted to synthesise the evidence on the neural bases of emotion processing in these groups as potential markers of psychosis vulnerability and expression. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nThe PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases were searched for published English-language articles applying an emotion processing task during fMRI in a FEP and/or a CHRp sample compared to healthy controls. References of included papers were also screened. For CHRp studies, only those including participants by the basic or attenuated symptom presentation criteria were included. \n\nIndividual study methodology and results were extracted and systematically reviewed. In addition, at present, statistical parametric mapping contrast maps (\u2018T-maps\u2019) are being collected from study authors and will be meta-analysed using the Seed-based d Mapping method. The contrasts meta-analysed will be the ones most commonly reported in the studies identified, i.e., of all emotion over comparison conditions and of negative emotion over neutral conditions. These will be meta-analysed separately, as behavioural evidence suggests that emotion recognition performance in these populations might be valence specific. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nFor the systematic review, 4,389 papers were identified through the search. 19 relevant fMRI papers were identified and their references were screened. 17 articles were included after full-text screening. Six out of twelve fMRI studies in the FEP population reported lower brain activation to emotion processing tasks compared to healthy controls. Four articles reported region-specific hyper- and hypoactivations and two studies found no significant difference. Of the seven studies in the CHRp population, one study reported lower brain response to emotion relative to healthy controls, two studies found hyperactivations, one study found region-specific increases and decreases, and two studies reported no significant difference. The most consistent finding across studies was lower amygdala activation in FEP participants (n=6). Conversely, in the CHRp population one article found an increase in amygdala response to emotion with age, consistently with one other article but contrasting with another study showing activity decreases in this region. \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nTo our knowledge, no previous systematic review or meta-analysis has synthesised the fMRI findings of emotion processing in both people at CHRp and a FEP. The present systematic review shows that while more consistent hypoactivations are found in the FEP population, results are less consistent in CHRp studies. The undergoing meta-analysis will quantitatively synthesise these findings. Elucidating the nature of emotion processing aberrances in early psychosis may help understand the functional changes across both vulnerability and symptom emergence phases and inform molecular investigations into its underlying mechanisms. \n\n \n\n# Body\n\n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7234314, "text_md5": "ed56904dd34dadcb3c81bdbb4bb536a8", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 79], "journal": [80, 94], "publication_year": [96, 100], "title": [111, 242], "keywords": [256, 256], "abstract": [269, 4007], "body": [4016, 4016]}, "batch": 2, "doi": "10.1093/schbul/sbaa029.693", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7234314", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7234314"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7234314\">7234314</a>", "list_title": "PMC7234314  T133.

Patients with this disease are often accompanied with cognitive impairment. However, the pathogenesis of the cognitive impairment remains unclear. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging is a kind of magnetic resonance imaging method based on blood oxygen level dependence. This can reflect the spontaneous brain functional activity of a human brain in the resting state. In recent years, a number of researchers have used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the changes in resting spontaneous brain function in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with cognitive impairment (TLE-CI). However, due to the differences in sample and methodology, the results of these studies were inconsistent. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the characteristics of the resting spontaneous brain function in patients with TLE-CI through a meta-analysis. \n\n\n## Methods: \n  \nA search was conducted on electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WANGFANG DATA and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Baidu scholar Database, from the establishment of the database to April 20, 2021.

This is a prevalent neurological disorder that affects approximately 50 million people worldwide.  However, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common refractory type of epilepsy, which refers to seizures that originate from the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and lateral temporal neocortex. Although under the control of anti-epileptic drugs, this can still affect human brain function in a slow and long-term manner. Furthermore, cognitive impairment is the major concern for these patients, such as damaging memory, attention, language, and executive control function.  But precise data on its incidence remains unclear.  At present, a number of studies have investigated the factors that contribute to cognitive dysfunction. It has been considered that these cognitive deficits are caused by complicated reasons, including anti-epileptic drugs, recurrent seizures, seizure severity, and organic brain disorders of the temporal lobe, seizure-induced head trauma, age of onset of epilepsy, and long duration of epilepsy.  However, the pathogenesis of the cognitive impairment remains unclear. \n\nIn patients with TLE, MRI studies have reported abnormal brain structures in hippocampus, entorhinal cortex,  thalamus,  and fornix.  Depending on voxel-based morphometry, white matter reductions ipsilateral to the seizure focus were also found in the temporopolar, entorhinal, and perirhinal areas.  Based on these studies, TLE originates unilaterally from the medial temporal lobe; they may be propagated from other regions which project to limbic areas. \n\nThe changes of whole brain function caused by epilepsy have also become a research hotspot. At present, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is being gradually applied in the diagnosis and research of epileptic brain function, providing neurophysiological and pathological evidence for the changes in brain function in epileptic patients. Among these, resting state fMRI has been extensively used to analyze the differences in activation characteristics of various brain regions in resting-state epilepsy patients and normal control groups through regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF).  Various studies have investigated the resting-state networks in temporal lobe epilepsy with cognitive impairment (TLE-CI) and TLE with the default mode network: activation of the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex in patients with verbal memory ; substantial decrease in activation in the neocortical, hippocampal, and parahippocampal regions in patients with 24-hour delayed verbal memory retrieval ; greater activation in the contralateral hippocampus in patients with worse memory performance.  However, the sample variables were small, and the results were inconsistent. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a systematic review of the literature that evaluated the changes in brain functional activities in patients with TLE-CI in fMRI. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study registration \n  \nThis protocol was registered with the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (INPLASY). The registration number is INPLASY202130092 (Doi: 10.37766/inplasy2021.3.0092). The protocol is according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) statement guidelines.  The results of this meta-analysis will be published in a journal or conferences. \n\n\n### Inclusion criteria \n  \n#### Types of participants \n  \nAdolescents and adult patients diagnosed with TLE (left or right) and cognitive impairment, according to any recognized diagnostic criteria, were included into the study. All participants were treated for their condition. \n\n\n\n### Types of study \n  \n#### Inclusion criteria \n  \nRandomized controlled trials that compared the fMRI cerebral alterations in TLE of patients with cognitive impairment and healthy controls; studies that reported the whole-brain results in 3-dimensional coordinates (x, y, z) for changes in standard stereotactic space (Talairach or MNI); studies that used thresholds for significance corrected for multiple comparisons or uncorrected with spatial extent thresholds. \n\n\n#### Exclusion criteria \n  \nStudies that only reported findings in regions of interests; studies that used coordinates relative to the analysis that employed small volume corrections in pre-selected regions of interests. \n\n Types of interventions:   None. \n\n\n\n### Search methods for the identification of studies \n  \n#### Search strategy \n  \nA systematic literature search was performed in the following electronic databases, from the establishment of database to April 20, 2021: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WANGFANG DATA and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Baidu scholar Database. Merely studies in the English and Chinese language were included for the study. \n\nThe following search terms were used: \u201cEpilepsy, Temporal Lobe\u201d, \u201cCognitive Dysfunction\u201d, \u201cNeurocognitive\u201d, \u201cDeterioration \u201d, \u201cDisorder \u201d, \u201cfMRI\u201d, \u201cfunctional MRI\u201d, \u201cReHo\u201d, and \u201cALFF\u201d. The sample for the search strategy for PubMed is summarized in Table  . \n  \nSearch strategy for PubMed. \n  \n\n#### Selection of studies \n  \nThe EndNote X9 document management software was used to filter the articles. Two researchers independently and carefully browsed the selected articles according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reasons for the exclusion of articles was recorded, and any disagreements were resolved through the consensus of all authors. The diagram of the selection of studies is shown in Figure  . \n  \nPRISMA flow chart. \n  \n\n\n### Data collection and analysis \n  \n#### Data extraction and management \n  \nTwo reviewers independently browsed the selected articles, and extracted and recorded the following information on Microsoft Excel: essential information: title, first author, publisher of the journal, year of publication, MRI type, and country; study design: inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization method, the definition of cognitive impairment, statistical analysis technique and patient characteristics, and sample size; participants: gender, age, and disease duration; results and conclusion. At all stages, any disagreement was resolved by discussion with a senior author. \n\n\n#### Data synthesis and statistical analysis \n  \nThe anisotropic effect size version of signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) software was used to analyze patients with TLE-CI and healthy controls through the ReHo or ALFFs between subjects. The peak coordinates in Talarach space were transformed into MNI space. In the experiment, if the result was a Z value, this was converted to the T value. AES-SDM was used to reconstruct the effect scales and statistical parameters for the increase and decrease in brain activation in each original study. \n\nThe Monte Carlo random number was set to 20. The full width at the half height of 20\u200amm was used to reconstruct the brain area difference map, and each voxel with a difference was given a corresponding weight value, which was as close as possible to the results of each study (if there were multiple assigned coordinates in a single study, the weighted value was adjusted). A meta-analysis was immediately performed after image reconstruction to calculate the voxel mass, with the statistical difference between TLE-CI patients and normal controls. In order to balance the sensitivity and specificity, the uncorrected   P  \u200a<\u200a.005 and voxel number \u226510 were used as the main thresholds. \n\n\n\n### Types of outcomes \n  \nSeparate analyses on functional brain response abnormalities were conducted using AES-SDM. This method uses the peak coordinates to recreate a statistical parametric map for each study. Then, a map would be created using the effect sizes of the differences between patients and controls, and a standard random-effects variance-weighted meta-analysis was conducted for each voxel. \n\n\n### Assessment of risk of bias \n  \nThe methodological quality of the randomized controlled trials was assessed using the risk of bias assessment tool, Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The total score of the scale was 9 points. If the score of the included literature was >6 points, this would be included into the study, while if the score was <6 points, it was excluded. This process was independently completed by 2 professional researchers. In case of any disputes, this was discussed by 2 researchers or resolved by a third researcher. \n\n\n### Sensitivity analysis \n  \nThe Jack-knife sensitivity analysis method was used to confirm the repeatability of the results. That is, the statistical analysis was repeated, and a different dataset was removed each time. This tested the repeatability of the results. \n\n\n### Meta-regression or subgroup analysis \n  \nThe meta-linear regression analysis method based on AES-SDM was used to explore the influence of age and disease duration in TLE-CI patients on the research results. The threshold range of   P  \u200a<\u200a.005 was set, and merely brain regions with a significant correlation between spontaneous brain function changes, and age and disease duration were reported. Finally, if adequate trials would be included, the following potential sources of heterogeneity would be explored using subgroup analyses or meta-regression: studies with low risk of bias, when compared to trials with high risk of bias; methods: ALFF\\ReHo; scan T: 1.5\\3.0. \n\n\n### Publication bias \n  \nIf more than 10 studies were included, a funnel plot would be used to evaluate the publication bias. Egger or Begg test would be conducted to analyze the potential publication bias, and the results would be estimated based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. \n\n\n### Ethics and dissemination \n  \nNo human or animal subjects or samples were/will be used. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, and will be disseminated at local and international neurology conferences. \n\n\n### Patient and public involvement \n  \nPatients were not involved in the development of the research question, outcome measures, and study design. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nNowadays, the mechanism of TLE cognitive impairment has not been fully elucidated, and studies suggest that cognitive impairment is closely related to the abnormal brain structure and function of patients. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging is used to observe the neural activities of various brain regions in the resting state, showing the interaction of brain neural networks. This paper aims to summarize the functional characteristics of the whole brain in patients with cognitive impairment of TLE, and to help us further understand the mechanism of cognitive impairment. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Conceptualization:   Qing Ye. \n\n Data curation:   Yiming Sun, Yuxuan Peng, Xueping Yang. \n\n Formal analysis:   Yu Dai. \n\n Funding acquisition:   Quan Wen. \n\n Investigation:   Xinru Liu, Qing Ye. \n\n Methodology:   Yuxuan Peng. \n\n Project administration:   Yiming Sun, Yu Dai. \n\n Software:   Yu Dai. \n\n Supervision:   Quan Wen. \n\n Validation:   Xinru Liu. \n\n Visualization:   Yiming Sun, Quan Wen. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   Qing Ye. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Yiming Sun, Qing Ye. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 8519237, "text_md5": "25baaa5bb8b3e135553df0164dbe5fd2", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 104], "journal": [105, 125], "publication_year": [127, 131], "title": [142, 221], "keywords": [235, 325], "abstract": [338, 2226], "body": [2235, 13680]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 34731102, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000027249", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8519237", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=8519237"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8519237\">8519237</a>", "list_title": "PMC8519237  Resting-state fMRI in temporal lobe epilepsy patients with cognitive impairment"}

The current study is a meta-analysis of functional MRI studies of psychopathy. Multilevel kernel density analysis was used to identify consistent findings across 25 studies (460 foci) of task-related brain activity. Psychopathy was associated with increased task-related activity predominantly in midline cortical regions overlapping with the default mode network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and precuneus) as well as medial temporal lobe (including amygdala). Psychopathy was related to decreased task-related activity in a region of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex overlapping with the salience network. These findings challenge predominant theories of amygdala hypoactivity and highlight the potential role of hyperactivity in medial default mode network regions and hypoactivity in a key node of the salience network during task performance in psychopathy. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nTwo decades of neuroimaging studies have begun to specify the neurobiological correlates of psychopathy, a personality disorder characterized by callous and impulsive antisocial behavior. Present in approximately one-quarter of adult male prison inmates , psychopathy is a significant predictor of violent reoffending  that costs the United States an estimated $460 billion per year , making psychopathy one of the most costly mental health disorders. Despite the accumulation of neuroimaging studies of psychopathy, a clear and comprehensive picture of the disorder\u2019s neural correlates has yet to emerge. \n\nSpecifying the neurobiological correlates of psychopathy could have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder, as well as for the criminal justice system. Clinically, the identification of neural correlates of psychopathy could inform the development of biomarkers for vulnerability and early detection, anatomical targets for intervention, and predictors of treatment response. Furthermore, given the relatively high prevalence of psychopathy among criminal offenders and its predictive utility for violent reoffending, there is growing interest in the relevance of neuroimaging data for predicting future offense , as well as for influencing sentencing of psychopathic offenders . Hence, neuroimaging research on psychopathy has multiple potential applications. \n\nNeuroimaging studies to date have generally tested specific theoretical models of neurobiological dysfunction in psychopathy. In fact, we identified 68 neuroimaging studies of psychopathy that used hypothesis-driven, region-of-interest (ROI) analyses, compared with 50 studies that used whole-brain analyses. The amygdala, in particular, is the focus of a robust literature on impaired fear and threat processing in psychopathy . Psychopathic individuals show diminished amygdala activity during aversive conditioning , facial emotion recognition , and moral judgment . Amygdala volume reductions  and surface deformations  have also been observed in psychopathic individuals. A region densely interconnected with the amygdala, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), has also received substantial attention in the psychopathy literature . Psychopathic individuals show reduced vmPFC activity during moral judgment  and reduced vmPFC volume . Amygdala and vmPFC have been identified by one theoretical perspective as the primary circuit of dysfunction in psychopathy . According to this perspective, deficits in these regions underlie psychopathic individuals\u2019 failure to pair negative and positive outcomes with their own actions. \n\nAnother perspective expands the scope of neural dysfunction beyond amygdala and vmPFC to the paralimbic cortex more broadly, including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), temporal pole, insula, and parahippocampal gyrus . Indeed, psychopathy has been associated with structural  and functional  abnormalities in these regions. Moreover, deficits similar to those of psychopathic individuals have been observed in patients with lesions in paralimbic regions, including vmPFC , ACC , and amygdala . \n\nPsychopathic individuals also display heightened sensitivity to rewards and sensation-seeking behavior , which has been linked to increased volume and activity in the striatum . Psychopathic individuals show enlargements in several subregions of the striatum, including caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens , and increased activity of nucleus accumbens during reward anticipation . Increased volume and activity in the striatum may thus contribute to psychopathic individuals\u2019 impulsive, sensation-seeking behavior. Although the studies outlined above highlight the importance of striatum and paralimbic regions\u2014particularly amygdala and vmPFC\u2014in psychopathy, reliance on primarily hypothesis-driven analyses may limit the identification of other relevant brain circuits. \n\nA recent meta-analysis of fMRI studies aimed to specify the neural correlates of psychopathy using a whole-brain approach . Psychopathy was negatively related to task-based activity in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and right amygdala, and positively related to activity in bilateral anterior insula. However, methodological characteristics of this recent meta-analysis limit the interpretations that can be drawn from these findings. First, the prior study included the effects of the distinct subsets of psychopathic traits in their meta-analysis of total psychopathy. Conflating subsets of psychopathic traits with the disorder itself could lead to the interpretation that a particular brain region or network is related to psychopathy overall, when in fact it is related to a restricted subset of traits. In addition, their meta-analytic method, activation likelihood estimate (ALE), uses coordinates of individual activation peaks as the unit of analysis, thereby potentially allowing a small number of studies reporting relatively high numbers of activation coordinates to drive the meta-analytic results . By contrast, the current state-of-the-art meta-analytic approach, multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA), uses the contrast map from an individual study as the unit of analysis and weighs study quality and sample size, allowing for greater generalization of findings . \n\nThus, the purpose of the current study is to use MKDA to identify consistent relationships between psychopathy and neural activity across a variety of tasks. Based on the previous findings reviewed above, psychopathy was predicted to be related to decreased activity in amygdala, vmPFC, ACC, PCC, and insula, and to increased activity in the striatum. The current study originally had three additional goals: (1) to identify structural neural correlates of psychopathy, (2) to identify neural correlates of two well-established subsets of psychopathic traits, and (3) to determine whether dysfunctional neural activity in psychopathy varies by task. However, an insufficient number of studies contributed to each of the models addressing these three goals. We present preliminary results from these models in the Supplementary Materials (Tables  \u2013 ), and focus our discussion on the functional neural correlates of psychopathy across tasks. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study selection and coding \n  \nWe conducted a forward literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, and a backward literature search in the reference sections of relevant papers. The following search terms were used in the forward literature search: psychopathy, psychopathic, magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI, and neuroimaging. Studies published prior to December 31, 2019 were included based on the following criteria: (1) reported peak coordinates in Talairach  or Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template space, (2) used whole-brain analyses, (3) sampled only participants aged 18 and older, (4) reported group statistics rather than single-case results, and (5) compared brain activity with a measure of psychopathy. The results from group comparisons (e.g., psychopaths vs. controls) and continuous analyses (i.e., variability across a range of psychopathy scores) were included. The resulting dataset included 460 foci from 87 contrasts in 25 studies of task-based functional activity (Table  ). Figure   displays the number of studies excluded at each stage of the literature search.   \nSummary of studies included in the functional meta-analysis for total psychopathy. \n  \n PCL-R   psychopathy checklist-revised ;   PPI-R   psychopathic personality inventory-revised ;   PSPS   primary and secondary psychopathy scales ;   SRP-SF   self-report psychopathy short form . \n     Flowchart of the literature search process.  \nAfter a full-text review, studies were excluded for using region of interest (ROI) rather than whole-brain analyses (68 studies), examining neural measures other than task-based neural activity (21 studies), summarizing prior literature rather than reporting new findings (18 studies), not reporting peak coordinates of findings related to total psychopathy (15 studies), grouping impulsive, non-psychopathic participants with psychopathic participants (1 study), excluding non-psychopathic participants from a continuous analysis of psychopathy (1 study), and reporting single-case results (1 study). \n  \n\nWe ensured that included contrasts were coded such that \u201cpositive\u201d activation indicated greater activity associated with the cognitive function of interest in each study. For example, contrasts from studies examining facial emotion processing were coded as fear faces\u2009>\u2009neutral faces , and contrasts from studies examining moral judgment were coded as moral\u2009>\u2009non-moral . Each reported coordinate was coded as relating positively or negatively to total psychopathy. Accuracy of the foci and corresponding information was verified by a second coder. \n\nWe determined that models with at least 15 included studies would achieve sufficient power in MKDA. Although no published standards exist for the number of included studies required for MKDA, there is evidence that 17\u201320 experiments are sufficient for another meta-analytic approach (ALE) . Given the statistical advantages of MKDA, we used a threshold of 15 studies. See Tables  \u2013  for preliminary results from models that did not meet this threshold. \n\n\n### Multilevel kernel density analysis \n  \nAnalyses were conducted using the MKDA toolbox in SPM12 . Foci in Talairach space were converted to MNI space . Binary indicator maps for each contrast were created by convolving peak foci using a 10-mm spherical kernel, with voxels related to psychopathy assigned a value of 1. Next, each indicator map was weighted by the square root of the study\u2019s sample size, and the weighted average of the indicator maps was computed. The resulting density maps represented the proportion of studies showing psychopathy relationships within 10\u2009mm. Finally, statistical thresholding was determined via 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations. The results were considered significant at   p  \u2009<\u20090.05 using height-based criteria or cluster extent-based criteria. Images for the figures were generated in AFNI (16.0) . Individual models were run for positive and negative relationships with total psychopathy. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nAcross all functional studies, total psychopathy was negatively related to neural activity in dorsal ACC (Fig.   and Table  ). In contrast, total psychopathy was positively related to neural activity in a large, bilateral portion of medial parietal and occipital cortex (including PCC and precuneus), bilateral dmPFC, right inferior frontal gyrus, right posterior orbitofrontal cortex, right medial temporal cortex (including amygdala), right hippocampus, and right parahippocampal gyrus (Fig.   and Table  ).

We discuss three main conclusions from these results. For two of the main conclusions, we draw on a body of literature that has identified three intrinsic, large-scale networks that serve core cognitive functions : the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and frontoparietal network (FPN). Whereas DMN increases activity during self-referential processing and decreases activity during externally focused, non-self-referential tasks , FPN increases activity during cognitively demanding, externally focused tasks . There is evidence that SN, which is particularly important for detecting salient external stimuli, is responsible for switching between the two anticorrelated networks, DMN and FPN . Our findings suggest that psychopathy is related to dysfunction within DMN and SN across a variety of tasks. \n\nFirst, we note the considerable overlap between the areas of psychopathy-related positive activity and the DMN, particularly in dmPFC and PCC/precuneus (Fig.  ). One interpretation, previously outlined by Freeman et al. , is that psychopathic individuals fail to deactivate these midline DMN regions during externally focused tasks. Such a failure could result in increased competition between DMN and externally oriented attention networks (such as FPN), disrupt the shift of attention to the external task, and lead to corresponding performance deficits . However, because the current meta-analytic evidence does not directly corroborate this interpretation, future studies are warranted to clarify whether overactivity within midline DMN regions in psychopathy reflects less task-associated deactivation or greater task-associated activation. Findings of reduced deactivation in DMN regions may align with theories that highlight attention deficits in psychopathy , although future studies could investigate whether dysfunction in networks involved in allocating attention to cognitively demanding tasks, such as FPN or SN, is more closely associated with psychopathic individuals\u2019 attention deficits. In psychopathy, PCC/precuneus is not only overactive across a variety of tasks, but also less functionally and structurally connected to other DMN regions, including dmPFC  and vmPFC , and to a region of FPN .    Large-scale networks and regions associated with psychopathy.  \n a   Overlap between default mode network (DMN) and regions of hyperactivity in psychopathy across a variety of tasks.   b   Overlap between salience network (SN) and regions of hypoactivity in psychopathy across a variety of tasks. A functional connectivity-based atlas was used to display canonical DMN and SN regions . \n  \n\nSecond, as predicted, psychopathy was related to reduced dorsal ACC activity across a variety of tasks. Research in healthy humans and animal populations has implicated the dorsal ACC in a number of processes, including experiencing negative affect and pain, cognitive control , and linking task context to strategy . As a key SN node (Fig.  ), the dorsal ACC, along with insula, is neuroanatomically situated to send rapid signals deactivating DMN and activating FPN . Indeed, there is evidence that SN functions at the top of a hierarchy that includes DMN and FPN, modulating the two anticorrelated networks via inhibitory connections to DMN and excitatory connections to FPN . Thus, one interpretation of reduced dorsal ACC activity in psychopathy, in combination with increased DMN activity, is that this SN node fails to properly deactivate DMN, leading to competition between attentional resources while psychopathic individuals are engaged in an externally oriented task. While speculative, the hypothesis of reduced SN influence on DMN activity could be tested via methods such as Granger causality  or dynamic causal modeling . Prior analyses of resting-state functional connectivity lend initial corroborating evidence of altered dynamics between the three networks: dorsal ACC (of the SN) and precuneus (of the DMN) are less functionally connected to the right intraparietal sulcus (of the FPN) in psychopathic offenders . \n\nNotably, some researchers have argued that common dysfunction within and between these intrinsic networks (DMN, FPN, and SN) underlies a range of psychopathology . For example, a diminished modulating effect of SN on DMN and FPN has been observed in patients with schizophrenia  and elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment . However, disorders may be distinguished by unique dysfunction in specific nodes of these core networks (e.g., hyperactive subgenual ACC in depression) . Further inquiry is necessary to establish whether hyperactivity in medial DMN nodes and underactivity in SN is unique to psychopathy or shared among other disorders. \n\nThird, we found overall increased levels of amygdala activity associated with psychopathy. Contrary to previous ROI-based studies, we observed no evidence of decreased amygdala activity across a variety of tasks. (Even preliminary analyses of socioemotional processing, e.g., facial emotion processing in Table  , failed to yield evidence of decreased amygdala activity.) This finding challenges predominant views in the field, which identify amygdala hypoactivity as a key neural deficit in psychopathy . Further research is thus necessary to more thoroughly characterize amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy, and the following considerations may guide those studies. First, the amygdala is a heterogeneous structure, with distinct subnuclei that subserve different functions and interact with different brain networks . Psychopathy may be linked to hyperactivity in specific amygdala subnuclei and hypoactivity in others, a possibility that has already been raised by one theoretical perspective . Indeed, several studies have found that amygdala relationships with psychopathy vary by subnucleus . Second, an emerging view proposes that, in healthy individuals, the amygdala may switch its affective mode (i.e., positive or negative, appetitive or avoidant) across situations . This raises the possibility that amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy varies by context. At a minimum, the present results suggest that amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy is more complex than simply reduced activation resulting in diminished fear conditioning. Future studies should examine whether altered modules (i.e., amygdala subnuclei) or modes account for this complexity. \n\nNo findings from the previous neuroimaging meta-analysis of psychopathy were replicated by the current meta-analysis . Prior findings of consistent hyperactivation in the fronto-insular cortex and hypoactivation in bilateral dlPFC, dmPFC, and right amygdala were not corroborated by our models. In fact, two findings diametrically oppose those of the previous meta-analysis: dmPFC and right amygdala were hyperactive in the current meta-analysis, but hypoactive in the previous study. Though unexpected, the differences in results could be at least partly attributed to methodological differences (i.e., study inclusion criteria, contrast selections, and meta-analytic methods), as detailed in the introduction of this paper. \n\nA primary limitation of the present meta-analysis is the exclusion of studies that employed ROI analyses, necessitated by MKDA\u2019s assumption that all included studies explored the same space (in this case, the whole brain). As a result, the present meta-analytic results do not represent the whole of the neuroimaging literature on psychopathy. This limitation could be overcome through the use of image-based meta-analysis, the \u201cgold standard\u201d of neuroimaging meta-analytic methods . Image-based meta-analysis requires the compilation of full statistical maps from each study to assess the overall effect sizes at each voxel. Although this method would present significant challenges, its results would offer a more complete picture of the underlying neurobiology of psychopathy. Further, the meta-analysis did not control for potential sample overlap between studies, nor did it consider separately the results from categorical or continuous analyses. While this meta-analysis included studies of community samples, which may feature relatively low levels of psychopathy, the results were largely unchanged when excluding these studies (Table  ). Last, the present results offer insights into aberrant neural activity, but no evidence regarding connectivity within networks, or how information is represented within specific brain regions in psychopathy. Previous studies have investigated the former , and machine-learning studies could address the latter. \n\nIn sum, these results associate psychopathy with neural abnormalities concentrated primarily in medial prefrontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. Crucially, no single current neurobiological theory of psychopathy accounts for the observed functional abnormalities, which include multiple cortical and subcortical regions. Consistent amygdala hyperactivity, observed here, challenges predominant views in the field that amygdala hypoactivity underlies psychopathy. A more complex characterization of amygdala function in psychopathy is necessary to account for previously observed hypoactivity and currently observed hyperactivity. Moreover, the present results highlight two intrinsic networks in which task-based activity is altered in psychopathy. Characterizing the dynamic interactions of these networks in future studies could potentially further illuminate a core neurobiological deficit of the disorder. The present meta-analysis thus provides novel insight into the neural correlates of psychopathy. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7203015, "text_md5": "f11b38423ef9fdd0d5546842d7483714", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 35], "journal": [36, 53], "publication_year": [55, 59], "title": [70, 142], "keywords": [156, 189], "abstract": [202, 1453], "body": [1462, 22424]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 32376864, "doi": "10.1038/s41398-020-0816-8", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7203015", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7203015"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7203015\">7203015</a>", "list_title": "PMC7203015  Functional neural correlates of psychopathy: a meta-analysis of MRI data"}

However, less is known about brain regions associated with non-conscious processing of faces, and whether a right-hemispheric dominance persists in line with specific affective responses. We aim to review the neural responses systematically, quantitatively, and qualitatively underlying subliminal face processing. PubMed was searched for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) publications assessing subliminal emotional face stimuli up to March 2022. Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses and narrative reviews were conducted on all studies that met ALE requirements. Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS tool. In a meta-analysis of all 22 eligible studies (merging clinical and non-clinical populations, whole brain and region of interest analyses), bilateral amygdala activation was reported in the left (x = \u221219.2, y = 1.5, z = \u221217.1) in 59% of studies, and in the right (x = 24.4, y = \u22121.7, z = \u221217.4) in 68% of studies. In a second meta-analysis of non-clinical participants only (  n   = 18), bilateral amygdala was again reported in the left (x = \u221218, y = 3.9, z = \u221218.4) and right (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4) in 56% of studies for both clusters. In a final meta-analysis of whole-brain studies only (n=14), bilateral amygdala was also reported in the left (x = \u221220.2, y = 2.9, z = \u221217.2) in 64% of studies, and right (x = 24.2, y = \u22120.7, z = \u221217.8) in 71% of studies. The findings suggest that non-consciously detected emotional faces may influence amygdala activation, especially right-lateralized (a higher percentage of convergence in studies), which are integral for pre-conscious affect and long-term memory processing. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nDetection of faces and the rapid initiation of appropriate emotional reactions constitutes part of the foundation for smooth social interactions and ultimately our survival. Visual search paradigms, such as \u201cface-in-the-crowd,\u201d highlight how the presence of a face, the direction of attention and whether it poses a potential threat, can be detected within the blink of an eye (Pinkham et al.,  ). This automatic processing is largely attributed to the emotional salience portrayed by a face, whereby expressions of anger, fear and disgust significantly raise our vigilance and give an evolutionary advantage for avoiding harm (Murphy and Zajonc,  ; \u00d6hman,  ). By contrast, difficulties with face perception may severely impact social cognitions, e.g., emotion recognition and interpretation of social cues, as seen in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia (Kleinhans et al.,  ; Gao et al.,  ). \n\nEmotion processing is suggested to be dichotomized, with one subcortical and subconscious pathway for emotionally salient stimuli, while the other pathway extends into cortex with integration in the amygdala for more detailed perceptual information (LeDoux,  ; \u00d6hman,  ). In support of the presence of these two separate pathways, delineating the neural pathways of subconscious face processing is often done with subliminal approaches using temporal backward masking and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) (Phillips et al.,  ; Kouider et al.,  ). By manipulating the time interval\u2014the Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA)\u2014between the target and the mask, the target stimulus can be interrupted as higher order mechanisms compete with the non-target in object recognition (Enns and Di Lollo,  ). Despite not being consciously perceived, subliminal stimuli can elicit behavioral and physiological responses, e.g., emotional memories, increased skin conductance, and accompanying neural activity (Sebastiani et al.,  ; Yang et al.,  ). For example, subliminal emotional faces, masked by neutral faces, activate similar brain areas as those presented supraliminally (Prochnow et al.,  ). These regions may include the amygdala, fusiform gyrus, the temporo-parietal junction, and the inferior, dorsolateral, and medial frontal cortex (Prochnow et al.,  ; Freeman et al.,  ). \n\nLesion and functional neuroimaging studies suggest that a hemispheric lateralization for face processing may exist, with the right hemisphere processing faces holistically and non-consciously, while the left appears to be involved in feature-based processing (Morris et al.,  ; Wada and Yamamoto,  ; Fr\u00e4ssle et al.,  ). Holistic processing is particularly important for face recognition, where key facial features are integrated as a whole rather than being perceived separately (Wang et al.,  ). Emotion processing is also suggested to be lateralized, according to two prevailing hypotheses (L\u00e0davas and Bertini,  ; Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). The right-hemispheric dominance hypothesis postulates that emotions are processed in the right hemisphere independent of their valence. The valence lateralization hypothesis claims that the left is responsible for processing positively valenced stimuli, while the right hemisphere processes negatively valenced stimuli (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). However, it has been debated whether right-hemispheric dominance occurs, and if this occurs independently of conscious awareness and the emotional valence of faces (Fusar-Poli et al.,  ; Gainotti,  ; Meng et al.,  ). \n\nTo answer these questions, and to address the variability of fMRI methodologies\u2014such as differences in participant samples, stimulus presentations, applied contrasts, coordinate systems (e.g., Talairach, MNI, and AFNI), scanner strength and statistical analyses\u2014Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses are effective. By analyzing coordinates from individual fMRI studies investigating similar questions, the convergence of foci can be detected with limited confounding effects of varying methodologies, e.g., by weighting foci according to sample size for each study and by using both the statistical significance of individual voxels and a minimum threshold for cluster size (Eickhoff et al.,  ). By doing this, probability maps of neuronal activation can be calculated that lowers the bias introduced by different studies (Kirby and Robinson,  ). In addition, diagnostic   post-hoc   tests and sub-analyses further improve the risk of bias (Radua and Mataix-Cols,  ). \n\nSeparate ALE approaches have previously been applied to study emotional facial processing and differences between subliminal and supraliminal stimuli (Fusar-Poli et al.,  ; Meneguzzo et al.,  ). In Brooks et al. ( ), significant ALE clusters for subliminally presented emotional faces were found in the right amygdala and the right cerebellum. A right hemisphere specialization for unconscious fear-related stimuli was also discussed in a narrative review by L\u00e0davas and Bertini ( ). However, there have been no ALE meta-analyses since 2012 focusing solely on subliminal emotional face processing and so now additional relevant fMRI studies have been published. As such, we aim to expand on Brooks et al.'s ( ) work by implementing the ALE method to quantitatively (in both whole brain and region of interest analyses) review neural responses underlying subliminal emotional face processing. To further nuance the quantitative ALE review, the goal of the qualitative review is to report emotion-specific neural responses to subliminal faces expressing the basic emotions of happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger (Ekman,  ). These six emotions are deemed universal and are suggested to be linked with distinct expressions and physiological changes (Ekman,  ). Identifying patterns of lateralization may shed light on underlying neural responses to emotional processing of faces, and hint at how facial processing might be altered in developmental and psychiatric disorders that have core deficits in emotion processing (such as autism, schizophrenia, eating disorders). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nWe followed the 10   Simple Rules for Neuroimaging Meta-analysis   (M\u00fcller et al.,  ): (1) Specificity of research question (what are the neural correlates of non-consciously processed emotional faces?). (2) Power of meta-analysis (meta-analyses presented here included   n   = 22,   n   = 18 and an exploratory analysis of more robust whole brain studies   n   = 14, with the suggested limit being   n   = 17\u201320). (3) Collect and organize data (the data extracted from studies are presented systematically in  ). (4) Experiments use the same search coverage (separate ALEs were conducted for all studies and whole brain only). (5) Adjust for multiple contrasts within experiments (no included studies contained multiple studies). (6) Double check data and report (Our data collection, inclusion/exclusion criteria, reported foci and analyses were conducted by AD, AS, and SB and compared). (7) Plan and register analyses (AD, AS, and SB discussed the contrasts to be done and separate analyses. Unfortunately, the protocol was not registered beforehand\u2014it was deemed an update of a previously published study: Brooks et al.,  ). (8) Balance sensitivity and susceptibility for false positives (a more conservative FWE correction was applied to all ALEs). (9) Show diagnostics (the number of studies contributing to the clusters, and the size/ALE value of the cluster were reported. A risk of bias assessment using the AXIS tool was reported). (10) Transparent reporting (detailed search terms, included studies and GingerALE parameters fully described). \n  \nfMRI studies included in ALE meta-analyses and narrative review (  n   = 22). \n    \n### Literature Search \n  \nThis review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al.,  ;  ). The review was not registered. The PRISMA checklist of recommended items to be reported can be found in  . A computerized search using the database PubMed was conducted, covering the periods from 1975 to March 2022 (last search 2022-03-24). Searches were conducted on titles and abstracts containing the following terms (  = truncated): (fMRI OR brain imaging OR functional magnetic resonance imaging) AND (sublim  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (unaware  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (implicit AND face  AND emotion ) OR (unconscious  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (non-conscious  AND face  AND emotion ) OR (sublim  AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (unaware  AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (implicit AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (unconscious  AND facial  AND emotion ) OR (non-conscious  AND facial  AND emotion ). Additional filters were utilized to refine the search further; these included: Adults (18+), human participants, English language, no reviews, no case studies, and no meta-analyses. \n  \nPRISMA flow diagram of the relevant steps for the literature search conducted in PubMed (Page et al.,  ). Out of the initial 943 identified studies, 22 fit the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis and narrative review. During the identification stage,   n   = 708 studies were removed prior to screening. The   n   = 238 remaining studies were screened and   n   = 76 studies were sought for retrieval. From the   n   = 74 reports assessed for eligibility,   n   = 52 studies were excluded according to exclusion criteria, leaving   n   = 22 studies. \n  \n\n### Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria \n  \nTo prevent selection bias, the PRISMA recommendations for systematic literature analysis have been followed and two authors (AD and AS) selected studies based on the broad search terms. Studies were included if they: (a) used task-based fMRI, (b) were conducted using subliminal/non-conscious presentation of faces using backward masking, (c) included human faces of any gender, race, age, and demonstrating any emotion vs. a neutral face or neutral image, (d) reported the neural activation or deactivation co-ordinates in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) or Talairach space, (e) assessed brain regional activation and deactivation using contrast analyses and not regression models, (f) were published in English, and (g) were published in a peer-reviewed journal article. Out of the initial 943 identified studies, 22 fit the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis and the narrative review ( ). During the identification stage,   n   = 708 studies were removed prior to screening. The   n   = 238 remaining studies were screened and   n   = 76 studies were sought for retrieval. \n\n\n### Selected Studies \n  \nOf the 74 publications assessed for eligibility, 52 did not meet the inclusion criteria ( ,  ). Studies were excluded if they did not provide within-subjects contrasts comparing subliminal emotional face stimuli with subliminal neutral stimuli, if the participants were conditioned to the stimuli, if the participants were children, if the participants were made aware of the subliminal presentations before testing and if MNI or Talairach coordinates were not reported. Thus, 22 publications remained and were included in the meta-analysis and the narrative review. Risk of bias in individual studies was assessed using the AXIS appraisal tool ( ). Of these 22 studies, eight were region of interest (ROI) studies, four were whole brain studies, and 10 reported both ROI and whole brain results. The total number of participants was   n   = 796 (50:50 women:men). In the first meta-analysis, all 22 studies (both ROI and whole brain) were included regardless of participant population; the second meta-analysis used only 18 studies (again both ROI and whole brain) that did not include clinical populations; the third meta-analysis excluded the 8 ROI studies (to prevent biasing of ALE results), and examined the 14 whole brain studies as an exploratory analysis. Across the reviewed studies, the subliminal emotional face stimuli expressed fear, happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and disgust. Control conditions included neutral faces, fixation cross, blank screen, no-face stimulus (a gray rectangle), visual noise masks of scrambled faces and non-emotional images (e.g., tomato). See   for details of included studies in both the quantitative and qualitative analysis. The analyzed contrasts from each study are reported in  . \n\n\n### fMRI Methods \n  \nFunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive brain imaging technique that indirectly measures neuronal activation   via   Blood Oxygen Level Dependency (BOLD). fMRI studies utilize either a whole brain or a ROI technique to measure BOLD. Using whole brain, significant activation clusters are localized by examining voxels across the global space. Conversely, ROI analyses use a mask to include or remove a brain area/areas from statistical analysis. ROI analyses are less favorable to include in ALE analyses as they tend to inflate the significance of the meta-analysis. ROI analyses differ from small volume correction (SVC) in terms of to what this test is applied and the subsequent output. For example, ROIs return a single   t  /  F  -value for the whole ROI, given that the test is applied to an average signal of all voxels. Conversely, in the SVC procedure, the test is applied to all voxels (voxel-wise) and therefore the output is a volumetric statistical map with   t  /  F  -values for each voxel within the small volume. ROI analyses were reported by eight studies included in the current meta-analyses, and so additional analyses were conducted to examine whether these ROI studies biased the overall findings. \n\n\n### Quantitative Data Analyses\u2014ALE \n  \nBrainMap GingerALE version 3.0.2 software (Laird et al.,  ; Turkeltaub et al.,  ) was used to complete the ALE analyses described above, with the updated version of the ALE approach (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Foci were extracted from publications examining neural responses to subliminal face perception, checked by two researchers (AS, SJB). Papers that reported coordinates in standard Talairach space were converted into MNI using the GingerALE software. Text files were subsequently created, listing the study names, number of subjects and a list of the foci (MNI coordinates) associated with neural activation to subliminal stimuli. Specifically, three separate ALE analyses were conducted: (a) utilizing all 22 publications incorporating both whole brain and ROI, and including all types of participant (e.g., clinical and healthy controls); (b) 18 publications that only examined subliminal face processing in healthy controls; (c) an exploratory examination including 14 publications of only healthy controls in whole brain studies (excluding ROI studies). Text files of foci were cross-checked by two researchers as above and are provided as   (Data Sheet). \n\nALE is a statistical modeling technique examining variance between and within fMRI studies using the total foci coordinates reported in each study to build a three-dimensional Gaussian kernel, enabling a modeled activation (MA) threshold map for each study (Eickhoff et al.,  ). Differences in foci positions can be a consequence of between-study variance, e.g., in templates used or heterogeneity of participants, and as such these two main issues are considered in the parameters of the kernel. This is done by weighting the foci reported by the number of participants in each study. Finally, MA maps for each study are combined for each separate meta-analysis, creating an experimental ALE map. This is tested against the null hypothesis that there is random variation in relation to the spatial orientation of neural activation for the specific meta-analysis (e.g., subliminal presentation of faces), but that the within-study variation is fixed. A random effects model is employed by the ALE analysis technique, which assumes a higher than chance likelihood of consensus between different experiments, but not in relation to activation variance within each study. The null distribution map is permuted by the number of studies that constitute each meta-analysis. To correct for multiple comparisons, we used a threshold of   p   < 0.05 False Discovery Rate (FDR), and chose a minimum cluster size of 100 mm , in accordance with our recent ALE publications on this subject (Brooks et al.,  ; Meneguzzo et al.,  ), and we also used a more conservative (as opposed to dilated) kernel threshold under ALE preferences (Eickhoff et al.,  ). We used an anatomical image overlay program called Mango ( ) to illustrate the results of our meta-analyses. GingerALE employs the term \u201ccontributing studies,\u201d to describe studies that are located within the boundaries of ALE cluster. However, this does not discount other studies that might be located near these boundaries but outside of the cluster, which could have also contributed to it. \n\n\n\n## Results\u2014Quantitative/ALE-Meta-Analysis \n  \nThe significant clusters including those that were significant at the cluster-level family-wise error (FWE) correction, with a more conservative (smaller) mask threshold, are reported in   for each meta-analysis, and in  . \n  \nClusters of statistically significant activation. \n    \nSignificant ALE cluster maxima of neural activation to subliminal emotional face stimuli surviving FDR correction,   p   < 0.05 for multiple comparisons, cluster size >100 mm . Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates are given. Meta-analysis 1 peak clusters: left amygdala (x = \u221219.1, y = 1.5, z = \u221217.1), right amygdala (x = 24.4, y = \u22121.7, z = \u221217.4). Meta-analysis 2 peak clusters: left amygdala (x = \u221218, y = 3.9, z = \u221218.4), right amygdala (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4). Meta-analysis 3 peak clusters: left amygdala (x = \u221220.2, y = 2.9, z = \u221218.4), right amygdala (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4). \n  \n### Meta-Analysis One: Significant ALE Clusters From All Studies \n  \nFrom 193 foci, 835 subjects, and 22 separate studies (24 experiments), the ALE analysis revealed two significant clusters that survived FWE correction. The first cluster was centered in the left amygdala (x = \u221219.2, y = 1.5, z = \u221217.1). The second cluster was centered in the right amygdala (x = 24.4, y = \u22121.7, z = \u221217.4). \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis Two: Significant ALE Clusters From Non-clinical Samples \n  \nFrom 168 foci, 647 subjects and 18 separate studies (18 experiments), two clusters survived the FWE correction. The first cluster was centered in the left amygdala (x = \u221218, y = 3.9, z = \u221218.4). The second cluster was centered in the right amygdala (x = 22.8, y = \u22120.9, z = \u221217.4). \n\n\n### Meta-Analysis Three: Significant ALE Clusters From Whole Brain Studies Only \n  \nWe also ran a separate exploratory analysis of the whole brain studies alone, excluding any studies which only conducted ROI analyses. From 144 foci, 541 subjects, and 14 studies, the ALE analysis revealed two clusters which survived FWE correction and the predefined cluster criterion. Cluster one was centered in the left amygdala (x = \u221220.2, y = 2.9, z = \u221217.2). Cluster two was centered in the right amygdala (x = 24.2, y = \u22120.7, z = \u221217.8). \n\nOf note, the highest percentage of contributing studies was 71% for activation in the right amygdala in whole brain studies only (  n   = 10), and while this was a small number of studies, this finding was corroborated by 68% of all studies reporting right amygdala activation to subliminal emotional faces (  n   = 15). \n\n\n\n## Results\u2014Qualitative/Narrative Review \n  \nA summary of the reported clusters of significant brain activation in response to subliminal emotional stimuli for each of the 22 included studies is presented in  . \n  \nSummary diagrams of the reported clusters of significant brain activation in response to subliminal emotional stimuli in the reviewed fMRI studies. Subliminally presented faces expressed   (A)   mixed emotional expressions,   (B)   sadness,   (C)   anger,   (D)   fear,   (E)   surprise,   (F)   happiness, and   (G)   disgust. The number within each bar indicates the   n   of the studies. ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; NAcc, nucleus accumbens. \n  \n### Emotional Faces: Anger, Happiness, and Sadness Combined \n  \nProchnow et al. ( ) presented facial expressions of anger, happiness, and sadness supraliminally (400 ms) or subliminally (40 ms). Both supraliminal and subliminal conditions of emotional faces elicited activation in the occipital cortex (OCC), fusiform gyrus, and caudal intra-parietal sulcus (cIPS), in comparison to baseline conditions with neutral face masks. Supraliminal emotional faces also activated the right superior temporal sulcus (STS), the right posterior cingulate cortex, the right superior colliculi, the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) bordering the anterior insula, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). For the subliminal emotional faces there was an increase in activation along the posterior right STS, the left premotor cortex area 6, and in the right DLPFC ( ). Control objects (supraliminal non-emotional images, e.g., chair, followed by unemotional adjective pairs) were associated with bilateral activation in the cerebellum, occipital cortex, dorsal paracingulate cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), DLFC, and left premotor area 6. \n\n\n### Fearful Faces \n  \nTen studies with healthy adult samples investigated the subliminal processing of fearful faces in comparison to neutral faces. Liddell et al. ( ) found that masked (16.7 ms) presentations of fearful facial expressions evoked significantly increased activity in the left superior colliculus, left pulvinar, bilateral amygdalae, and bilateral anterior cingulate. The right amygdala showed a larger cluster of activation than the left. Whole brain analysis confirmed the significant activity observed in the left ventral anterior cingulate seen in the ROI analysis. Whole brain analysis also demonstrated significant responses to subliminal fear in fronto-temporal and somatosensory-related cortices. \n\nIn Pichon et al. ( ), subliminal face presentation was conducted using both forward masking and backward masking (66 ms after the prime) with visual noise masks (scrambled face stimuli). The subliminal faces elicited activations in the bilateral occipital face area (OFA), right fusiform face area (FFA), bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG BA45 and BA47), but no activation in the amygdala. Fearful face primes resulted in left parahippocampal gyrus activation, which was enhanced when the target faces appeared at the expected rather than the unexpected time. However, significant changes in activation in the amygdala and FFA were not found. Unlike the influence of temporal attention, the gender congruence of the prime and target face did not influence the parahippocampal gyrus activation. \n\nWhen comparing subliminal and supraliminal presentations of fearful facial expressions, Williams et al. ( ) detected significant activity in the left amygdala, the left dorsal ACC and in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) extending to the right hemisphere in supraliminal fear conditions relative to neutral conditions. Subliminal fear conditions, relative to neutral, elicited significant activity in the bilateral amygdala and ventral right MPFC, extending into the ventral ACC. Whole brain analysis between-conditions confirmed that supraliminal fear had significantly greater responses relative to subliminal fear in DLPFC and visual regions. In contrast, subliminal fear elicited comparatively greater responses in the right hypothalamus and the right ventral ACC. \n\nYang et al. ( ) used encoding and retrieval phases to investigate the affective priming effect for fearful faces. Backward masked fearful or neutral faces were presented during the encoding and during the retrieval participants judged the fearful or neutral expression of the target face. Participants who were unaware the subliminal priming had stronger activation in the left amygdala, while participants who were aware of the priming had stronger activity in the left prefrontal cortex, left occipital region and the left fusiform gyrus. Moreover, unaware participants primed with fearful faces (vs. neutral) produced greater activity in the right amygdala and the right pulvinar. In aware participants, fearful faces generated stronger activity in the left amygdala, right fusiform gyrus and the left STS. They also found a congruency effect whereby congruent faces (fearful\u2013fearful) elicited weaker amygdala activation than incongruent faces (neutral\u2013fearful). \n\nThe supraliminal (179 ms) and subliminal fearful faces (30 ms) were presented to male participants in Phillips et al. ( ). Both conditions activated regions of visual processing: the left precuneus, the bilateral superior and the right middle temporal gyri for subliminal fear, and bilateral superior and the right middle temporal and lingual gyri and precuneus for supraliminal fear. Both supraliminal and subliminal fear activated the left inferior frontal and right anterior cingulate gyri, bilateral inferior parietal lobules, and the right cerebellum. Voxels of significant activation in the right amygdala were detected in the supraliminal fear condition, but not in the subliminal condition. Subliminal fear elicited activation in the left caudate nucleus. Moreover, the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left inferior parietal lobule and bilateral cerebellum showed significantly greater mean power of response to subliminal fear than supraliminal presentations of fear. \n\nMasked fear (33 ms) in Etkin et al. ( ) elicited significant activation in the right basolateral amygdala, which was also found to be correlated with anxious traits in the healthy adult sample. Non-masked fear (200 ms) did not lead to basolateral amygdala activation, but instead right dorsal amygdala activation, which was not correlated to anxiousness. Chen et al. ( ) observed right amygdala activation in response to masked fearful faces vs. neutral faces, while non-masked fearful faces vs. neutral faces activated the left amygdala. \n\nEleven out of 12 male participants in Mathiak et al. ( ) showed amygdala responses to fearful faces, whereby seven subjects had bilateral activation, three had left-lateralized activation and one right-lateralized activation. However, volume-corrected thresholds for masked fearful stimuli did not generate significant amygdala activity. Nor did masked fearful faces in Cui et al. ( ) generate significant activation in their predefined ROIs (bilateral amygdala, insula, ACC, mPFC, and orbitofrontal cortex) or in the ROIs of Suslow et al. ( ) (amygdala, thalamus, caudate nuclei, and putamen). \n\n\n### Happy Faces \n  \nOf the reviewed fMRI studies with healthy adult participants, eight included masked happy faces in their subliminal paradigms. Dannlowski et al. ( ) found significant activations in the bilateral amygdala for subliminally presented happy faces (33 ms) followed by a neutral target face (467 ms). Likewise, adult women in Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd ( ) showed significant activation within the left and right amygdala following happy faces masked by neutral faces. In addition, they detected clusters of elevated activation in the bilateral anterior cingulate gyri. The observed right amygdala activation and bilateral anterior cingulate gyri activation during the masked happiness condition were found to be significantly greater than in the masked sadness condition. Suslow et al. ( ) reported clusters of significant activation in response to masked happy faces in the right inferior parietal lobule to right middle temporal regions and in the right thalamus. These clusters were also positively correlated to implicit extraversion measures. \n\nHappy faces presented subliminally in Duan et al. ( ), elicited increased neural activity in the left amygdala, anterior cingulate, left inferior frontal/orbito-frontal gyrus, and right inferior temporal gyrus, in comparison to neutral faces. When contrasting masked happy faces with masked surprised faces, the happy faces were associated with increased activation of the left posterior cingulate gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Masked presentation of happy faces may also activate the bilateral nucleus accumbens (NAcc), as demonstrated in Suslow et al. ( ). The right NAcc activation was also found to have a significant positive correlation with the affective priming score of the neutral target face, however no significant priming based on happy faces was established. \n\nIn Victor et al. ( ), females showed reduced BOLD responses to masked happy vs. masked neutral faces in the left amygdala, the right subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), and the right pregenual ACC (pgACC), relative to men. When amygdala activity was recorded in response to masked faces with happy, sad and angry expressions using fMRI in Dannlowski et al. ( ), no significant effect of gender was observed for any of the investigated emotions. Regarding happy faces vs. neutral faces, no significant bilateral amygdala activity was found during subliminal presentation. However, in comparison to the no-face baseline, subliminal happy faces elicited activations in the right amygdala. Masked happy faces in Cui et al. ( ) did not generate significant activation in their predefined ROIs (bilateral amygdala, insula, ACC, mPFC, and orbitofrontal cortex). \n\n\n### Sad Faces \n  \nFive of the studies examined the brain activation patterns elicited by subliminal faces with sad expressions in healthy adults. Dannlowski et al. ( ) found that sad faces presented subliminally (33 ms) followed by a neutral target face (467 ms) significantly activated the bilateral amygdala. Suslow et al. ( ) also found significant bilateral amygdala activation following the masked presentation of sad faces. This amygdala activation had significant positive correlations with the affective priming scores given to the neutral target faces. In addition, whole brain analysis revealed a positive correlation between medial frontal gyrus activation and the affective priming score based on sad faces, which was significantly higher than the positive correlation between amygdala activation and affective priming scores. \n\nThe subliminal presentation of sad faces in Dannlowski et al. ( ) yielded significant bilateral amygdala activity, in comparison to both neural faces and the no-face baseline. In addition, greater amygdala responses to masked sad sadness were associated with more negative bias scores given to neutral target faces. However, in the female sample of Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd ( ), masked sad faces only generated significantly greater activation within the right amygdala, whereas the left amygdala did not show significant activation. When compared to the masked happiness condition, the masked sadness did not have any suprathreshold voxels within the ROIs. Female participants in Victor et al. ( ), showed elevated BOLD responses to viewing masked sad faces vs. masked happy faces in the right hippocampus and the bilateral sgACC, compared to male participants. \n\n\n### Angry Faces \n  \nThe processing of subliminal angry facial expressions was investigated in four of the reviewed studies ( ). Significantly increased bilateral amygdala activity was seen for masked angry faces, in comparison to neutral faces, in Dannlowski et al. ( ). However, the elevated amygdala activity following presentation of angry faces was not significantly higher than the no face baseline condition. Similar to the sad faces, the stronger amygdala activation in response to masked angry faces was associated with more negative bias scores given to neutral target faces. Cui et al. ( ) found a cluster of activation in the rostral ACC in response to masked angry faces. Rostral ACC activation was also correlated with higher scores on measures of anger and anxiety. In Nomura et al. ( ), the anger prime, neutral prime and control conditions all produced activation in the right fusiform gyrus. Right amygdala activation was only detected in the anger prime condition. Moreover, the responses in the right amygdala had a significant negative correlation with activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus within the angry face prime condition. A significant positive correlation was found between the rate of judgment of anger of the target face and activation intensity in the right amygdala. In Chen et al. ( ) neither subliminal nor supraliminal angry faces elicited amygdala activation in comparison to neutral faces. \n\n\n### Surprised Faces \n  \nOne of the reviewed fMRI studies focused on the neural responses to surprised faces presented below conscious awareness. In comparison to masked neutral faces, masked surprised faces were associated with higher activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, right amygdala, and right thalamus (Duan et al.,  ). Above threshold activation was also detected in clusters within the occipital lobe and temporal lobe. When comparing masked surprised faces with masked happy faces, surprise showed increased activation in the bilateral amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and cingulate gyrus. Clusters of suprathreshold activation were also present in the cerebellum, inferior frontal gyrus, temporal, and occipital lobes. \n\n\n### Disgusted Faces \n  \nDisgusted faces were investigated by Phillips et al. ( ) using subliminal (30 ms) and supraliminal (170 ms) presentations in a male sample. Both conditions activated regions of visual processing: the right fusiform gyrus, precuneus, and middle temporal gyrus in response to subliminal, and the right precuneus, left middle occipital, bilateral lingual, right superior, and left middle temporal gyri in response to supraliminal faces of disgust. Significantly activated voxels were also detected in the bilateral posterior cingulate and right anterior cingulate gyri and the left cerebellum. In addition, supraliminal disgust activated bilateral insulae, while subliminal disgust did not. Subliminal presentations of disgust activated the right thalamus and putamen. Suslow et al. ( ) also used backwardly masked disgusted faces (17 ms) in healthy adult men and women. The subliminal faces of disgust generated clusters in the bilateral anterior cerebellum and the cerebellal lingual. \n\n\n### Studies With Clinical Samples \n  \nThe participants in Dannlowski et al. ( ) suffered from acute major depression. They described clusters of significant activation in both the left and right amygdala for subliminal sad faces vs. neutral faces, and for subliminal angry faces vs. neutral faces. In contrast, the subliminally presented happy faces did not elicit significant changes in brain activation in comparison to neutral faces. No activation by masked happy faces could be detected in comparison with the neutral face baseline. However, when compared to a no-face baseline, masked happy faces were associated with activations in the right amygdala. In participants with an acute major depressive episode, amygdala responses to masked sad faces were greater than responses to masked happy faces (Suslow et al.,  ). The bilateral amygdala responses to subliminal faces expressing sadness were also significantly greater than the bilateral amygdala responses seen in healthy control subjects shown subliminal sad faces. In contrast, the healthy control group had greater bilateral amygdala responses to happy compared with sad faces and compared with the depressed group's bilateral amygdala responses to happy faces. \n\nRedlich et al. ( ) used fMRI to investigate the automatic processing of subliminally presented emotional faces in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) before and after treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), in a control sample of MDD patients treated with pharmacotherapy and in a healthy control sample. Both MDD groups had increased bilateral amygdala activity to sad faces compared to the healthy control group at baseline. There was no significant difference for the happy face condition between the groups at baseline. After ~6 weeks with brief pulse ECT treatment or pharmacotherapy, both MDD groups displayed a reduced bilateral amygdala activity in reaction to subliminal sad faces. The pharmacotherapy MDD group also demonstrated a significant increase in amygdala activity to subliminal happy faces, but the ECT MDD group did not. Moreover, no significant differences in amygdala activity in response to subliminal emotional faces compared to controls was detected after 6 weeks with brief pulse ECT treatment or pharmacotherapy, indicating a normalization of the MDD patient groups. \n\nIn Ottaviani et al. ( ), healthy control participants showed bilateral amygdala activation in response to backward masking of fearful faces, while participants with panic disorder did not. Masked fearful faces elicited higher amygdala responses than masked neutral faces. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present ALE meta-analysis explored neural activation in response to subliminal emotional faces during fMRI and found bilateral clusters of activation in the amygdala across all studies, as well as those that only examined healthy participants, and those only using whole brain analyses. Meta-analysis one, combining ROI studies with both clinical and non-clinical samples demonstrated bilateral amygdala activation, with a higher percentage of studies reporting right amygdala activation. Meta-analysis two, which only examined non-clinical samples also reported bilateral amygdala, converging equally on left and right. Finally, meta-analysis three presented only whole-brain studies, and again demonstrated bilateral amygdala activation, most often reported by studies on the right side. Moreover, the narrative review highlighted how the degree of positive or negative affect of the subliminally presented faces may elicit different patterns of neural activation. In particular, increased activation was observed across corticolimbic regions, but predominantly visual cortex areas in response to general subliminal emotional faces. Fearful and happy faces tended to activate bilateral limbic regions ( ). Of the studies examining sad and angry faces, a potentially right-specific amygdala/fusiform area response was detected. Surprise and disgust appeared to activate subcortical regions in the few studies that examined these emotions. \n\n### Right-Lateralized Amygdala Activation During Subliminal Conditions in Non-clinical ROI Studies and Whole Brain Studies \n  \nAccording to the affective circumplex model, emotions contain two independent dimensions: valence (the negative or positive nature of the emotion) and arousal (the heightened physiological activity caused by the emotion), which activate distinct neural pathways (Posner et al.,  ; Gerber et al.,  ). The subcortically located amygdala has long been considered a key region for processing faces and their emotions, as lesions within the amygdala can severely impair emotion recognition (Adolphs et al.,  ). The amygdala has also been suggested to encode the different dimensions of emotion in a lateralized manner (Wang et al.,  ). The right amygdala may preferentially subserve the uncertainty of a stimulus' valence, while the left may decode the emotional arousal of a stimulus (Gl\u00e4scher and Adolphs,  ; Colibazzi et al.,  ; Wang et al.,  ). When contrasting subliminal and supraliminal emotion processing, the right amygdala has been implicated in automatic responses to emotion, while the left amygdala is activated during conscious reflection following emotional stimuli (Dyck et al.,  ; Pantazatos et al.,  ). A potential explanatory model could therefore involve a right amygdala-driven automatic and global emotional response, followed by a left amygdala-driven differentiated emotional reaction which incorporates information on arousal to further guide cognition and behavior (Gl\u00e4scher and Adolphs,  ; Pantazatos et al.,  ). \n\nThe present findings of significant ALE clusters within the right amygdala, based on the reviewed non-clinical ROI studies and the whole brain studies, slightly differ from the bilateral activation following subliminal emotional faces found in Brooks et al. ( ). However, while Brooks et al. ( ) argued for more robust right amygdala activation, prior imaging studies have also reported elevated left amygdala activation in response to emotionally arousing stimuli such as facial expressions (Morris et al.,  ; Lane et al.,  ; Vytal and Hamann,  ). More specifically, left amygdala activation has been associated with fearful facial expressions (Hardee et al.,  ). However, of the 10 reviewed studies using fearful face masks, the reports of significant amygdala activation were mixed. Liddell et al. ( ) and Yang et al. ( ) reported bilateral amygdala activity with greater right lateralization. Etkin et al. ( ) and Chen et al. ( ) also reported right amygdala activation. Conversely, Williams et al. ( ) detected significant left amygdala activation, while Phillips et al. ( ), Mathiak et al. ( ) Suslow et al. ( ), Cui et al. ( ), and Pichon et al. ( ), did not detect significantly altered amygdala activity in either hemisphere for the subliminal fear conditions. The significant right amygdala clusters detected at group level may therefore be due to the different emotional face expressions, e.g., happiness and sadness, used across the included non-clinical ROI studies. Likewise, the experimental designs of the 14 studies included in the whole brain analysis used subliminal faces with varying emotional valence which could underlie variance in amygdala activation. \n\n\n### Right Parahippocampal Gyrus Activation During Subliminal Conditions in Non-clinical ROI Studies and Whole Brain Studies \n  \nTwo of the conducted ALE analyses, including whole brain studies analyzed separately, revealed significant right-lateralized activation which could be interpreted as merging onto the parahippocampal gyrus, which is located anteromedially to the amygdala and adjacent to the hippocampus. In addition to the amygdala-centered network, the hippocampus-centered network plays a pivotal role in emotion processing (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). By integrating emotional information from the amygdala,   via   the ACC, the hippocampal complex modulates the consolidation and retrieval of emotional memories (Carlson et al.,  ; Bian et al.,  ). The parahippocampal gyrus takes part in the limbic system and its activation together with the amygdala is in accordance with previous ALE meta-analyses on implicit emotion processing (Li et al.,  ; Shi et al.,  ), Interestingly, Shi et al. ( ) found that masking tasks were associated with parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala activation, while inattention tasks of implicit emotional processing preferentially activated the fusiform gyrus. The different activation patterns elicited by masking tasks and inattention tasks, respectively, suggest that the former targets early stages of emotional processing while the latter captures a later stage of pre-attentive emotional processing (Shi et al.,  ). The results provide support for the ability of emotional faces to rapidly activate subcortical brain regions, before cortical structures are recruited to evaluate the emotional stimulus and coordinate an appropriate response (LeDoux,  ; \u00d6hman,  ). \n\nParadigms using supraliminal emotional stimuli (e.g., emotionally evocative sentences), have detected strong associations between elevated amygdala and parahippocampal activity and arousal ratings (Colibazzi et al.,  ; Meneguzzo et al.,  ). Indeed, emotional arousal is a well-established mediator in memory consolidation   via   the amygdalo-hippocampal-parahippocampal network (Dolcos et al.,  ). The current findings of clusters with significant activation within the right amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus for subliminal emotional faces, suggests how non-conscious stimuli may influence memory formation and thereby guide behaviors by facilitating the recognition of familiar faces and the emotions they may be expressing. For example, attentional biases toward masked fearful faces may predispose individuals to anxiety or exacerbate sensations of threat, despite being in a safe environment (Carlson et al.,  ). This may in turn lead to a generalization of contextual fear, as seen in posttraumatic stress disorder, which can severely impact everyday life (Bian et al.,  ). \n\nAnger has previously been associated with activations of the right parahippocampal gyrus (Vytal and Hamann,  ). Here, Nomura et al. ( ) and Dannlowski et al. ( ) did not report significant changes in parahippocampal gyrus activity during masked anger conditions. However, surprised faces were associated with higher activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus (Duan et al.,  ), whereas fearful face primes generated left parahippocampal gyrus activation (Pichon et al.,  ). Victor et al. ( ) detected gender differences with female participants demonstrating elevated BOLD responses to masked sad faces vs. masked happy faces in the right hippocampus, compared to male participants. Functional interaction studies have proposed distinct amygdala neural signatures associated with supraliminal facial expressions of different emotions (Diano et al.,  ). As the current meta-analysis did not conduct separate ALE analyses for each subliminally presented emotion, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the valence lateralization hypothesis, where the left processes positively valenced stimuli and the right processes negatively valenced stimuli (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). However, the indications of right-lateralized amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus activity from the reviewed ROI studies and whole brain studies, regardless of emotional valence, suggests that the right-hemispheric dominance hypothesis may apply to subliminal processing as well (Palomero-Gallagher and Amunts,  ). \n\n\n### Right Striatum Activation During Subliminal Conditions in Non-clinical ROI Studies and Whole Brain Studies \n  \nSome studies reported in the narrative review demonstrate increased activation to subliminal emotional faces in the striatum. The striatum is comprised of the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and is primarily known for its role in voluntary motor control (B\u00e1ez-Mendoza and Schultz,  ). Neuroimaging work has highlighted the striatum's involvement in integrating social information and reward processes (B\u00e1ez-Mendoza and Schultz,  ). Moreover, the ventral striatum has been found to be more sensitive to subliminally presented faces in comparison to supraliminally presented faces (Ito et al.,  ). \n\nDuring emotion identification, the striatum has been suggested to act in opposition to the amygdala (Satterthwaite et al.,  ). For example, while the amygdala may preferentially react to threatening angry or fearful faces, the striatum may be tuned to detect non-threatening sad or happy faces (Satterthwaite et al.,  ). While two of the studies in the current review reported increased putamen and nucleus accumbens activation in response to masked happy faces (Duan et al.,  ; Suslow et al.,  ), three reported putamen and caudate activation in response to masked negative emotions (Phillips et al.,  ; Liddell et al.,  ; Dannlowski et al.,  ). Despite the mixed emotional valences, the right striatum activation seen in the reviewed studies, suggests that subliminal face processing is not only important for threat perception but also for drawing our attention to cues which could lead to social rewards, such as social inclusion (B\u00e1ez-Mendoza and Schultz,  ). \n\n\n### Clinical Samples of Major Depressive Disorder and Panic Disorder \n  \nMood disorders are often characterized by emotional dysfunctions which manifest as abnormal affective processing and behaviors, such as altered reward appraisal and negative attentional biases (Diekhof et al.,  ). When it comes to face processing, depressed patients may have trouble recognizing neutral faces and have been shown to wrongfully ascribe sadness to supraliminal neutral expressions (Lepp\u00e4nen et al.,  ). Prior work has attributed these depression-related tendencies to amygdala hyperactivity, but it is not yet established whether this aberrant processing should be regarded as a causal factor or a clinical manifestation of depression (Stuhrmann et al.,  ). Intriguingly, a hyperactive amygdala state can also be detected during the subliminal presentations of sad faces, as indicated by the reviewed studies with MDD patients (Dannlowski et al.,  ; Suslow et al.,  ; Redlich et al.,  ). The MDD participants also had greater amygdala responses to masked sad faces in comparison to masked happy faces, while the opposite was seen for the healthy controls (Suslow et al.,  ). \n\nA previous ALE meta-analysis comparing MDD patients and healthy volunteers also found different brain activation patterns depending on the stimulus valence (emotional faces or words; Groenewold et al.,  ). Negative stimuli elicited greater activation in the right amygdala, left striatum, dorsal anterior cingulate and parahippocampal areas in the MDD participants. The same brain regions were activated in response to positive stimuli, but to a lesser extent than the healthy controls (Groenewold et al.,  ). The opposing neural activation patterns, with the amygdala highly tuned to negative information (Murray et al.,  ), and lower activity in the ventral striatum tuned to positive information (Diekhof et al.,  ), support a negative attention bias in depression where negative stimuli may be preferentially processed (Gotlib et al.,  ). Given that subliminal faces expressing sadness may also elicit elevated amygdala responses in MDD patients, as seen in Suslow et al. ( ) and Redlich et al. ( ), it is emphasized how depression-relevant information may be subconsciously processed and is therefore difficult to change. However, Redlich et al. ( ) demonstrated how amygdala activity in response to subliminal emotional faces can be normalized in MDD patients following 6 weeks of ECT treatment or pharmacotherapy. This highlights the possibilities of altering dysfunctional emotional face processing in mood disorders. \n\nIn contrast to the above findings from MDD patients, participants with panic disorder did not show amygdala activation in response to backward masking of fearful faces in Ottaviani et al. ( ). Although the masked fearful faces did elicit higher amygdala responses than the masked neutral faces. Patients with panic disorder suffer from recurrent panic attacks, accompanying physical symptoms such as an increased pulse or chest pain, and anticipatory anxiety (Sobanski and Wagner,  ). Supraliminal presentations of emotional faces have previously generated increased amygdala activation in participants with anxiety disorders when viewing fearful faces relative to happy faces, compared with healthy controls (Fonzo et al.,  ). Furthermore, anxiety-prone individuals have been shown to have significantly higher bilateral amygdala and insula activation to emotional faces (Stein et al.,  ). A hyperactive insula has also been associated with panic disorder diagnoses (Fonzo et al.,  ). The insula is associated with interoceptive processes which signal internal body states (Sobanski and Wagner,  ). Elevated insula activity may therefore reflect an increased sensitivity to distressing body sensations in individuals with panic disorder (Fonzo et al.,  ). As Ottaviani et al. ( ) relied on a ROI-based analysis for the amygdala only, no results were reported for the insula. \n\n\n### Strengths and Limitations \n  \nA major strength of the current study is the use of ALE methodology which addresses the difficulties with meta-analyzing fMRI studies, due to the different statistical contrasts used in creating neural activation images. An additional strength is that the right amygdala activation (extending into the right parahippocampal gyrus) remained significant when the analysis was re-run without the ROI studies, which strengthens the findings. However, the ALE approach does not account for the intensity of the BOLD signal reported in each study. It is also possible that differences in the fMRI set-ups and participant instructions could have influenced the results. The results may also have been affected by differences in the sample demographics. For example, Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd ( ) only tested women, while Phillips et al. ( ) and Mathiak et al. ( ) only included men. However, there were not enough studies to conduct an ALE to examine gender differences. \n\nThe studies in the current meta-analysis all used masking tasks which have been proven useful for examining the early stages of implicit emotional processing (Shi et al.,  ). Of note, binocular rivalry and interocular suppression approaches can also be used in the study of emotional face processing, but this meta-analysis only included studies using masking tasks (Alpers and Gerdes,  ; Yang and Yeh,  ). The studies presented the masks for 40 ms or shorter, which is deemed sufficient to prevent the conscious detection of the prime stimulus (Esteves and \u00d6hman,  ). However, detection of non-conscious primes can occur below 40 ms (Szczepanowski and Pessoa,  ), which is why it is important to pair the masking tasks with a subsequent detection task to ensure that the participants did not perceive the masked stimulus. Both subjective and objective criteria to test the potential awareness of the prime were used across the reviewed studies ( ). Some studies relied solely on subjective reports of visual awareness (e.g., Duan et al.,  ; Mathiak et al.,  ; Prochnow et al.,  ). Other studies used objective discrimination thresholds where unaware perception was defined as by chance performance in forced-choice detection tasks (e.g., Liddell et al.,  ; Ottaviani et al.,  ; Pichon et al.,  ). As information about the non-conscious stimulus may only be accessible for a limited time, it may fade before visual awareness can be self-reported and lead to incorrect assumptions being made for the subliminal experimental conditions. Therefore, objective criteria may be more suitable as a determinant (Pessoa et al.,  ; Pichon et al.,  ). However, running sub-analyses for studies using objective or subjective criteria was unfortunately not possible due to the limited number of whole brain studies in this ALE. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThis study is, to our knowledge, the first ALE meta-analysis focusing on fMRI studies of subliminal emotional face processing. Clusters of significant activation were detected in bilateral amygdala, with most study convergence in the right amygdala, in response to non-consciously presented multi-valenced images of faces. Given the integral role of the amygdalo-hippocampal-parahippocampal network in memory formation, it is compelling to consider how these brain regions may be activated without conscious awareness. An impaired ability to interpret emotional facial cues may be particularly worrisome for individuals suffering from mental health conditions. Future fMRI studies of non-consciously presented, multi-valenced affective stimuli will be important in delineating the implicated neural pathways in both functional and dysfunctional states. \n\n\n## Data Availability Statement \n  \nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ , further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s. \n\n\n## Author Contributions \n  \nAD: manuscript preparation, investigation, formal analysis, and data curation.

White matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 4.4), dementia (1.9, 1.3 to 2.8), and death (2.0, 1.6 to 2.7). An association of white matter hyperintensities with a faster decline in global cognitive performance, executive function, and processing speed was also suggested. \n\n Conclusion   White matter hyperintensities predict an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death. Therefore white matter hyperintensities indicate an increased risk of cerebrovascular events when identified as part of diagnostic investigations, and support their use as an intermediate marker in a research setting. Their discovery should prompt detailed screening for risk factors of stroke and dementia. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAs magnetic resonance imaging has become widely available and brain magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly being carried out in various clinical settings, clinicians often have to deal with the incidental discovery of white matter lesions, appearing as hyperintensities on T2 weighted images (fig 1 ). In the general population the prevalence of white matter hyperintensities ranges from 11-21% in adults aged around 64 to 94% at age 82.  Pathological findings in regions of white matter hyperintensity include myelin pallor, tissue rarefaction associated with loss of myelin and axons, and mild gliosis.  These lesions are located in the deep white matter, typically sparing subcortical U-fibres, and are often seen together with vessels affected by small vessel disease.  The affected vessels are presumed to induce the lesions in deep white matter through chronic hypoperfusion of the white matter and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, leading to chronic leakage of plasma into the white matter.  White matter hyperintensities are more common and extensive in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and symptomatic cerebrovascular disease.  White matter hyperintensities can be measured quantitatively and non-invasively on large population samples and have been proposed as an intermediate marker, which could be used for the identification of new risk factors and potentially as a surrogate end point in clinical trials. \n  \n Fig 1  \u2002White matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging (axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequence) in two 80 year old patients: (left) minor white matter hyperintensities; (right) extensive white matter hyperintensities predominating in periventricular region. White matter lesions are considered present if hyperintense on T2 weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, and proton density images, without prominent hypointensity on T1 weighted images \n  \nSeveral studies have assessed the relation between white matter hyperintensities and risk of stroke, dementia, and death, with partly conflicting results. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed all published longitudinal studies that tested the association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke, dementia, and death, both in the general population and in a hospital based setting. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nUsing predefined search terms we identified references through searches of PubMed from 1966 to 23 November 2009 (see web extra methods 1). We also identified papers by reviewing the reference lists of relevant articles. \n\n### Study selection \n  \nStudies were limited to those in adults. We included only prospective studies with longitudinal data on the association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke, dementia, cognitive decline, and death. We excluded studies if they evaluated white matter lesions only by computed tomography (because of the lower sensitivity of this method for measuring white matter lesions compared with magnetic resonance imaging ); carried out magnetic resonance imaging at the end of follow-up instead of at baseline; or had a sample size of fewer than 50 patients. For studies with more than one publication describing results among overlapping groups of participants and with the same outcome measure, we included only the dataset with the longest follow-up. If the follow-up period was identical we included only the dataset with the largest number of patients (see web extra methods 2). \n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nFrom the studies we extracted data on number of participants, general population versus high risk participants, mean age, duration of follow-up, characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging and definition of white matter hyperintensities, outcome definition (all strokes versus intracerebral haemorrhage or ischaemic stroke; all types of dementia versus Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia, mixed vascular and Alzheimer\u2019s dementia; and neuropsychological measurements used to assess cognitive decline), and number of events that occurred during follow-up. For the measure of the association between white matter hyperintensities and the outcome we recorded, when available, hazard ratios, odds ratios, and adjustment variables when applicable. Both authors extracted the information from each study, resolving any disagreements by discussion. \n\n\n### Variable definition \n  \nWe defined studies as being in high risk populations if they were carried out in people selected for the presence of prevalent disease such as mild cognitive impairment, stroke, or other vascular events, or for the presence of a high risk factor profile. (See web extra tables 1-5 for the inclusion criteria for each study.) Stroke was defined as an acute onset focal neurological deficit of presumed vascular cause lasting at least 24 hours or interrupted by death within 24 hours. Web extra tables 1-5 show the number of events by stroke type (ischaemic versus haemorrhagic), when available. Unless specified differently (see web extra tables 1-5) we defined dementia according to the criteria of the   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  , third or fourth editions ; Alzheimer\u2019s disease based on the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Disorders Association for definite, probable, or possible Alzheimer\u2019s disease ; and vascular dementia according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l\u2019Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria.  Cognitive decline was defined as worsening performance on repeated neuropsychological tests. In the absence of consensus on which neuropsychological test was the most appropriate, we did not apply restrictions on type of test used. We examined separately tests of global cognitive function and tests assessing performances in specific cognitive domains (see web extra tables 1-5 for types of test used in each study). \n\nWeb extra table 6 details study quality criteria, including loss to follow-up, surveillance carried out for the diagnosis of incident events, description of the definition used for these events, and event subtypes. We also report the availability of effect estimates and whether the analysis took into account time to event. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nCochrane RevMan version 4\u00b72 software ( ) was used to carry out meta-analysis of the outcomes dementia, stroke, and death. Graphs were designed using the rmeta package in R ( ). We calculated pooled hazard ratios using the random effects inverse variance method. In a few studies only odds ratios were available despite the longitudinal design,  therefore we considered the odds ratios as approximations of hazard ratios.  Significant heterogeneity was defined by a P value <0.05 or I  >50%. We carried out meta-analysis when at least three studies were available for the same outcome; we included only studies that used a categorical measure of white matter hyperintensities. When more than two categories were present we used the hazard ratio for the highest category compared with the lowest category. Studies for which the association of white matter hyperintensities with the outcome was studied solely in a continuous fashion (per unit increase or standard deviation increase in quantitative volume of white matter hyperintensities or semiquantitative grade for white matter hyperintensities) were not included in the meta-analysis. Indeed, white matter hyperintensities were measured on completely different scales in the various cohorts, using either automated quantitative volume measures or different types of visual semiquantitative non-linear volume measures. Although a sample size weighted meta-analysis could be done, this would not provide a pooled effect estimate. When both adjusted and unadjusted values were available for the hazard ratio, we included the value adjusted for vascular risk factors. For studies that measured deep white matter hyperintensities and periventricular hyperintensities separately and did not provide a global risk estimate for white matter hyperintensities, we meta-analysed the results for periventricular hyperintensities (see web extra methods 3). In a secondary analysis we reran the meta-analysis replacing the results for periventricular hyperintensities with those for deep white matter hyperintensities. All meta-analyses were done separately for population based studies and studies in a high risk population, and overall. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \nThe initial search identified 958 articles, of which 53 met the inclusion criteria.  This included 14 studies for stroke,  20 for dementia,  21 for cognitive decline,  and 11 for mortality.  Some studies contained data on more than one outcome. Because of an overlap with another larger study carried out in the same population on the same outcome, seven studies were excluded: two on stroke,  three on dementia,  two on cognitive decline,  and one on mortality.  Hence a total of 46 studies was included in this systematic review ; 12 for stroke,  17 for dementia,  19 for cognitive decline,  and 10 for mortality. \n\n### White matter hyperintensities and incident stroke \n  \n#### Incident stroke overall \n  \nSix population based studies  and six studies in high risk populations  examined the relation between white matter hyperintensities and incident stroke (see web extra table 1). All six population based studies could be included in the meta-analysis (fig 2 ), which showed a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke (hazard ratio 3.1, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 4.1, P<0.001). Three studies done in high risk populations could be included in the meta-analysis (fig 2), showing a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with the risk of stroke (7.4, 2.4 to 22.9, P=0.001).  Three studies in high risk populations could not be included in the meta-analysis, two because white matter hyperintensities were studied continuously only,  and a third because only intracerebral haemorrhage was studied as an outcome (see web extra table 1).  All three found a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with incident stroke. \n  \n Fig 2  \u2002Inverse variance meta-analysis of studies testing association of white matter hyperintensities with incident stroke \n  \nThe meta-analysis combining the data from population based and high risk populations yielded a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with incident stroke (3.5, 2.5 to 4.9, P<0.001; see web extra fig 2). \n\n\n#### Incident stroke types \n  \nFew data existed on the association of white matter hyperintensities with specific stroke types (intracerebral haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke). One community based study  found a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with incident ischaemic stroke; another study did not observe any association of white matter hyperintensities with recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage in patients with lobar haemorrhage (see web extra table 1). \n\n\n#### Progression of white matter hyperintensities and incident stroke \n  \nOnly one study assessed the relation between progression of white matter hyperintensities and incident stroke, in 89 patients with a history of lacunar stroke, headache, or dizziness: a significantly increased risk of stroke was observed in patients with progression of white matter hyperintensities after 4.3 years compared with those with no progression. \n\n\n\n### White matter hyperintensities and incident dementia \n  \n#### Incident dementia overall \n  \nThree population based studies  and 11 studies in high risk populations  examined the relation between white matter hyperintensities and incident dementia overall (see web extra table 2). Meta-analysing the three population based studies yielded a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with the occurrence of all types of dementia (2.9, 1.3 to 6.3, P=0.008; fig 3 ).  Six of the 11 studies done in high risk populations could be included in the meta-analysis,  yielding no significant association of white matter hyperintensities with incident dementia (1.4, 0.9 to 2.3, P=0.14). Four of these six studies included patients with mild cognitive impairment : meta-analysing these separately also did not yield any significant association (1.1, 0.8 to 1.6, P=0.46; see web extra fig 2). Five studies in high risk populations could not be included in the meta-analysis, three because white matter hyperintensities were studied continuously only,  and two because the authors reported the absence of association without indicating numbers (see web extra table 2).  None of them identified a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with incident dementia. Not all quality criteria were satisfied for several of the studies (see web extra table 6). \n  \n Fig 3  \u2002Inverse variance meta-analysis of studies testing association of white matter hyperintensities with incident dementia \n  \nWhen combining data from population based studies and high risk populations the risk of dementia associated with white matter hyperintensities was increased overall (1.9, 1.3 to 2.8, P=0.002; fig 3, also see web extra fig 3). \n\n\n#### Incident subtypes of dementia \n  \nThree population based studies  and three studies in high risk populations  investigated the relation between white matter hyperintensities and incident Alzheimer\u2019s disease (see web extra table 2). Only one population based study  and two studies in high risk populations  fulfilled our predefined criteria for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of these yielded a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (see web extra fig 4). \n\nTwo population based studies  and one study in a high risk population  tested the relation between white matter hyperintensities and incident vascular dementia (see web extra table 2). We did not carry out a meta-analysis as only two studies fulfilled our predefined criteria for meta-analysis,  but all three studies found a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with incident vascular dementia (see web extra table 2). \n\n\n#### Progression of white matter hyperintensities and incident dementia \n  \nOne study observed that increasing volume of white matter hyperintensities during a two year follow-up was associated with incident dementia in depressed patients.  Another study, in people with white matter hyperintensities of varying degree and mild neurological problems, found that increasing degrees of progression of white matter hyperintensities over a three year period were associated with a higher rate of conversion to dementia. \n\n\n\n### White matter hyperintensities and cognitive decline \n  \n#### Global cognitive decline \n  \nFive population based studies assessed the relation between volume of white matter hyperintensities and global cognitive decline (see web extra table 3).  Three studies observed that white matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of low global cognitive test scores,  conversion to mild cognitive impairment, or persistent cognitive impairment at the end of follow-up.  In one study, white matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of incident amnestic mild cognitive impairment in participants aged over 60,  but did not predict incident mild cognitive impairment overall. Two studies found that increasing periventricular hyperintensities only predicted a higher rate of annual decline in mini-mental state examination scores,  or of conversion to persistent cognitive impairment. \n\nEight studies carried out in high risk populations examined the relation of white matter hyperintensities with global cognitive decline (see web extra table 3).  Five of them found that increasing baseline volume of white matter hyperintensities was associated with a more noticeable decline in global cognitive function.  The other three studies observed no association. \n\n\n#### Decline in domain specific cognitive functions \n  \nTwo population based studies evaluated the relation of volume of white matter hyperintensities with decline in domain specific cognitive functions : one found a significant association of periventricular hyperintensities (but not deep white matter hyperintensities) with decline in processing speed and executive function,  whereas the other study observed no association of baseline burden of white matter hyperintensities with decline in any cognitive domain. \n\nFour studies in high risk populations assessed the relation between white matter hyperintensities and decline in specific cognitive domains : all found an association of baseline white matter hyperintensities with more rapid change in executive function or processing speed. In two of these studies the association was assessed separately for periventricular hyperintensities and deep white matter hyperintensities and was significant for periventricular hyperintensities only. \n\n\n#### Progression of white matter hyperintensities and global cognitive decline \n  \nTwo population based studies examined the relation of progression of white matter hyperintensities with decline in global cognitive functions (see web extra table 4).  Both found that increasing progression of white matter hyperintensities was associated with a greater deterioration in global cognitive score; in one study this association was significant for periventricular hyperintensities only. \n\n\n#### Progression of white matter hyperintensities and decline in domain specific cognitive functions \n  \nFour population based studies tested the association of progression of white matter hyperintensities with decline in domain specific cognitive scores (see web extra table 4).  One study observed a significant association of progression of white matter hyperintensities with decline in memory performance, conceptualisation, and visuopractical skills.  The three other studies found an association of progression of white matter hyperintensities with a faster decline of executive functions or processing speed.  In one study this association was significant for periventricular hyperintensities only. \n\nTwo studies tested the association of progression of white matter hyperintensities with decline in domain specific cognitive scores in high risk populations.(see web extra table 4).  One study, in patients with vascular risk and no pre-existing cognitive impairment, found an association of progression in volume of periventricular hyperintensities with decline in executive function.  The other study, in patients attending memory clinics who were already cognitively impaired, found no association of progression of white matter hyperintensities with memory or executive function. \n\n\n\n### White matter hyperintensities and mortality \n  \nFour population based studies  and six studies in high risk populations  prospectively investigated the relation between white matter hyperintensities and mortality (see web extra table 5). All four population based studies could be included in the meta-analysis (fig 4 ), which showed a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of death (2.3, 1.9 to 2.8, P<0.001). Four studies done in high risk populations could also be meta-analysed (fig 4); this showed an association of white matter hyperintensities with mortality (1.6, 1.01 to 2.7, P=0.04). Two studies could not be included because white matter hyperintensities were studied continuously only,  both found a significant association of white matter hyperintensities with mortality (see web extra table 5). When studies from both population based samples and high risk populations were pooled, white matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of death during follow-up (2.0, 1.6 to 2.7, P<0.001; fig 4, also see web extra fig 5). \n  \n Fig 4  \u2002Inverse variance meta-analysis of studies testing association of white matter hyperintensities with mortality \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis systematic review of 46 studies, and meta-analysis, provides strong evidence that white matter hyperintensities are an important indicator of future risk of disease, being associated with an increased risk of stroke, cognitive decline (especially in the executive function and processing speed domains), dementia, and death. \n\n### Incident stroke \n  \nWhite matter hyperintensities were significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke, both in the general population and in high risk populations with a history of stroke or vascular disease. It could be hypothesised that this association merely reflects the relation of vascular risk factors with stroke. Indeed, age and hypertension are the main predictors of white matter hyperintensities,  and other vascular risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, and history of vascular disease were also shown to be associated with lesions in white matter.  In all studies, however, the association of white matter hyperintensities with stroke remained significant after adjustment for vascular risk factors. Although some residual confounding may exist, this suggests that white matter hyperintensities reflect either the overall effect of uncontrolled vascular risk factors better than the mere presence or absence of each individual factor or that other, yet unknown, factors play a role in the association of white matter hyperintensities with stroke. \n\n\n### Incident dementia and cognitive decline \n  \nWhite matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of dementia in the general population, but not in studies on high risk populations (mainly with mild cognitive impairment or a history of stroke). When subtypes of dementia were assessed, the three studies that investigated the relation of white matter hyperintensities with incident vascular dementia found a significant association, both in the general population and in patients with mild cognitive impairment.  Conversely, although the meta-analysis testing the relation of white matter hyperintensities with incident Alzheimer\u2019s disease yielded an overall significant association, this association was driven by the large population based study,  whereas the two smaller studies on patients with mild cognitive impairment did not identify any association.  Finally, our systematic review suggests that, in most studies looking at the association of white matter hyperintensities with decline in cognitive performance, white matter hyperintensities were associated with a faster decline in global cognitive performance as well as in executive function and processing speed. This was true both in the general population and in high risk patients with mild cognitive impairment, memory problem, or cerebrovascular disease. \n\nVarious potential mechanisms could account for the association of white matter hyperintensities with dementia. Firstly, subcortical neural networks could be damaged directly. Consistent with this hypothesis is the predominant association with decline in executive functions (believed to depend on cortical-subcortical circuits passing through the white matter), which could be disrupted by damage to white matter.  Secondly, white matter hyperintensities could interact with pathological changes related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and thereby accelerate their clinical expression, or vice versa.  Thirdly, white matter hyperintensities could be a confounder reflecting the association of vascular risk factors  or of concomitant ischaemic damage to the cortex with dementia. Several studies have adjusted for vascular risk factors, for prevalent or incident stroke, or for concomitant magnetic resonance imaging defined brain infarcts, and found similar results,  suggesting that vascular risk factors are unlikely to be a major mechanism, although undetected cortical microinfarcts cannot be excluded.  Finally, reverse causation through amyloid angiopathy or wallerian degeneration as a result of cortical atrophy has been hypothesised.  However, data from the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study suggest that progression of lesions in white matter precedes loss in parenchymal volume in elderly people without dementia, implying that this reverse causation is unlikely to play a predominant role. \n\nThe finding that white matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease mainly in healthy populations and not in high risk patients who are already cognitively impaired, needs to be interpreted cautiously. Studies in high risk populations were carried out in small samples and had several methodological flaws. If this lesser association in higher risk and cognitively impaired populations is confirmed, however, it could suggest that once the neurodegenerative lesions become clinically evident, the effect of white matter lesions may be less important.  As has been suggested by others, the presence of white matter hyperintensities may increase the risk that an individual will develop mild cognitive impairment or have declining performances on cognitive tests but may not be enough to facilitate progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, the latter being overwhelmingly driven by neurodegenerative lesions.  An exception could be the rare cases of pure vascular dementia, where diffuse white matter hyperintensities could be important also at later stages of cognitive decline and conversion. \n\n\n### Mortality \n  \nWhite matter hyperintensities were significantly associated with an increased risk of death both in the general population and in high risk populations with a history of stroke, depression, or minor neurological symptoms. This association could be mediated by an increased risk of stroke and dementia. However, both in the Rotterdam and the Framingham Offspring Study the association of white matter hyperintensities with mortality did not disappear after accounting for incident dementia or stroke.  The association was more noticeable for cardiovascular mortality,  which could reflect that white matter hyperintensities are a surrogate for an important burden of vascular risk factors and a marker of diffuse vascular damage involving not only the arteries supplying the brain but also peripheral and coronary arteries. \n\n\n### Effect of progression of white matter hyperintensities \n  \nOnly three studies have assessed the impact of progression of white matter hyperintensities on incident stroke and dementia, suggesting a significant association of increasing progression of white matter hyperintensities with these outcomes.  Progression of white matter hyperintensities has been more widely studied in association with cognitive decline, with increasing progression predicting a more rapid decline in global cognitive performance and executive function. \n\n\n### Limitations of the review \n  \nAlthough we corrected for statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analyses, the measurement and analysis of white matter hyperintensities varied substantially (see web extra tables 1-5). One important source of heterogeneity was the automated quantitative versus visual semiquantitative measurement of white matter hyperintensity volume, although visual semiquantitative scales were shown to correlate well with volumetric measures.  Furthermore, total intracranial volume was unequally included in the analyses to account for differences in head size, and not all studies explicitly distinguished white matter hyperintensities from lacunar infarcts. Consensus recommendations on the measurement of white matter hyperintensities and their progression, as have been published for instance for carotid intima-media thickness,  would be useful to improve the comparability of future studies. Another limitation is that some studies could not be included in the meta-analysis because white matter hyperintensity was studied only as a continuous variable using different scales. All the results, including those that were not incorporated in the meta-analysis, are available in web extra tables 1-5. The pooled hazard ratios for dichotomous measures of burden of white matter hyperintensities also need to be interpreted with caution, given the heterogeneous definitions of these measures across studies. They should therefore not be extrapolated to estimate the individual risk of stroke, dementia, or death in a patient with white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging. To be as comprehensive as possible in this review we included studies using different tests or criteria for the diagnosis of cognitive decline and dementia, which is an additional source of heterogeneity. Finally, given the strong association of vascular risk factors both with burden of white matter hyperintensities and with the clinical outcomes we studied, it would be interesting to assess the modifying effect of these risk factors on the associations we reported. This was not feasible in the present paper, however, as the nature and definition of vascular risk factors included in the analyses varied substantially across studies. \n\n\n### Implications of the review \n  \nThe findings of this review have several implications. For the clinician, they emphasise the clinical importance of white matter hyperintensities, even when these are found as incidental findings on brain imaging. In such cases doctors might consider detailed screening for risk factors for stroke and dementia, even though the benefit of doing so is not formally proved. Although data showing that treatment of risk factors reduces the progression of white matter hyperintensities are limited, more aggressive antihypertensive treatment was associated with reduced progression in patients after stroke, as well as with a reduction in stroke itself. \n\nIn terms of research, white matter hyperintensities could constitute a potentially useful intermediate marker for the identification of new risk factors for stroke and dementia. Indeed, besides being strongly associated with the risk of stroke and dementia, white matter hyperintensities can be quantified reliably and non-invasively on large samples and can be measured as a continuous trait, thus providing increased statistical power to detect an association. White matter hyperintensities could prove particularly interesting for the identification of novel genetic risk factors, as their heritability was shown to be as high as 55-73%. \n\nWhite matter hyperintensities may also have a role as a surrogate marker to assess treatment efficacy. Despite the importance of treatment, few have been shown to be specifically effective in the small vessel disease subtype of stroke. Treatment trials for small vessel disease face major challenges, including relatively slow progression of the disease necessitating large patient populations.  Neuropathological studies have shown that white matter hyperintensities usually represent pathological small vessel disease,  therefore white matter lesions may be useful to screen treatments before evaluation in much larger clinical studies, using stroke and dementia as clinical end points.  The European Task Force on Age-Related White Matter Changes estimated that 195 people with confluent lesions would be required per treatment arm to show a 20% reduction in the rate of disease progression over three years.  Criteria have been proposed for the use of imaging markers as surrogate markers for treatment trials.  The first criterion was that the marker must be able to predict the natural course of the disease and should correlate with relevant clinical features in both cross sectional and longitudinal studies. Our meta-analysis provides strong evidence that this applies to white matter hyperintensities. A second criterion was that therapeutic interventions can delay progression of surrogate markers and that this correlates with reduced occurrence of clinical end points. Support for this is available from the magnetic resonance imaging substudy of the Perindopril Protection against Recurrent Stroke Study, which revealed a less noticeable progression of white matter hyperintensities with aggressive antihypertensive treatment, particularly in the subgroup of patients with a higher volume of white matter hyperintensities at study entry ; an effect on clinical end points (stroke and cognitive decline) was also found in the main study. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nIn conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis provides strong evidence that white matter hyperintensities predict the risk of stroke, dementia, and mortality. This emphasises that white matter hyperintensities indicate increased cerebrovascular risk when identified clinically as part of diagnostic investigations and supports their use as an intermediate marker in a research setting. Further studies assessing the impact of progression of white matter hyperintensities on stroke and dementia are needed to help design therapeutic trials incorporating progression of white matter hyperintensities as an intermediate end point. \n \n#### What is already known on this topic \n    \nStudies have assessed the relation between white matter lesions and risk of stroke, cognitive decline, dementia, and mortality \n  \nThe results are, however, partly conflicting \n  \nHeterogeneity of study designs, imaging types, setting, sample size, and follow-up makes the interpretation of published data difficult \n  \n\n#### What this study adds \n    \nWhite matter hyperintensities are associated with an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death \n  \nFor stroke and death the association was present in both community based and high risk populations, whereas for dementia the association was significant for community based patients only \n  \n \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 2910261, "text_md5": "df0ad337eac811b9012d2155ef52836f", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 34], "journal": [35, 38], "publication_year": [40, 44], "title": [55, 184], "keywords": [198, 198], "abstract": [211, 2176], "body": [2185, 35989]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 20660506, "doi": "10.1136/bmj.c3666", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910261", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2910261"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910261\">2910261</a>", "list_title": "PMC2910261  The clinical importance of white matter hyperintensities on brain magnetic resonance imaging: systematic review and meta-analysis"}

There is growing evidence, however, to support an alternative model, which proposes that neural areas associated with specific inhibitory control tasks co-exist as common network mechanisms, supporting diverse cognitive processes. This meta-analysis of 225 studies comprising 323 experiments examined the common and distinct neural correlates of cognitive processes for response inhibition, namely interference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation. Activation coordinates for each subcategory were extracted using multilevel kernel density analysis\u00a0(MKDA). The extracted activity patterns were then mapped onto the brain functional network atlas to derive the common (i.e., process-general) and distinct (i.e., domain-oriented) neural network correlates of these processes. Independent of the task types, activation of the right hemispheric regions (inferior frontal gyrus, insula, median cingulate, and paracingulate gyri) and superior parietal gyrus was common across the cognitive processes studied. Mapping the activation patterns to a brain functional network atlas revealed that the fronto-parietal and ventral attention networks were the core neural systems that were commonly engaged in different processes of response inhibition. Subtraction analyses elucidated the distinct neural substrates of interference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation, revealing stronger activation in the ventral attention network for interference resolution than action inhibition. On the other hand, action withholding/cancellation primarily engaged the fronto-striatal circuit. Overall, our results suggest that response inhibition is a multidimensional cognitive process involving multiple neural regions and networks for coordinating optimal performance. This finding has significant implications for the understanding and assessment of response inhibition. \n\n## Electronic supplementary material \n  \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00429-017-1443-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nResponse inhibition refers to the ability to suppress automatic actions or behaviors that are not appropriate or no longer adaptive to the situation (Aron  ; Goldman-Rakic et al.  ). Dysfunctional response inhibition is a core symptom observed in various mental disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Schachar et al.  ), schizophrenia (Vercammen et al.  ), and depression (Palazidou  ), as well as learning difficulties (Eickhoff et al.  ) and behavioral problems (Liu et al.  ). Thus, understanding of response inhibition and its neural correlates in the healthy population could not only enhance our knowledge of cognitive neural networks but also offer a unique platform for identifying and clinically addressing neural markers of dysfunctional response inhibition. \n\n### Measurement of response inhibition \n  \nParadigms such as the stroop, Flanker, Simon, stimulus response compatibility (SRC), antisaccade tasks, stop signal, and Go/NoGo tasks, which require a response to a target stimulus among irrelevant/distracting stimuli, are commonly regarded as paradigms that involve inhibitory action control (Nigg  ) and are commonly used for the investigation of response inhibition mechanisms (Nee et al.  ; van Velzen et al.  ; Swick et al.  ; Stahl et al.  ; Nigg  ). In stop signal and Go/NoGo tasks, increased automatic tendency to initiate a particular motor response is induced through a higher frequency of go trials than inhibition trials (i.e., NoGo or stop). The resultant action bias has to be suppressed when the inhibition signal is presented during NoGo or stop trials. In the Go/NoGo task, participants have to withhold a prepotent but not yet initiated motor response, whereas the stop signal task cancels an already initiated motor response. In the other tasks, which can be organized under the term \u201cincongruency tasks\u201d (Cieslik et al.  ), a given stimulus dimension interferes with relevant stimuli and/or response information, thereby affecting responses to the relevant information. \n\nThese tasks all require cognitive control over a predominant response tendency and the context-dependent initiation of an appropriate behavioral alternative\u2014that is, either to initiate an alternative, nondominant response, or to not respond at all. Given the similarities and differences across these tasks, it is important to explore whether their neural correlates are shared, distinct, or both. To achieve this goal, we categorized these paradigms into three subcategories: inference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation (Sebastian et al.  ; Stahl et al.  ; Friedman and Miyake  ; Hasher et al.  ). Interference resolution is the process of selecting information with regard to its relevance to an ongoing task and suppressing the processing of irrelevant information (Yarkoni et al.  ). This process is usually tested by the Stroop, Simon, Flanker, SRC, and antisaccade tasks (Stahl et al.  ; van Velzen et al.  ). Comparatively, action withholding is commonly assessed using the Go/NoGo task. The stop signal task is conceptualized as an action cancellation task. \n\n\n### Neural correlates of response inhibition \n  \nOver the past 15\u00a0years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of studies examining neural correlates of response inhibition using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (refer to Fig.\u00a0 ). Based on the results of these studies, several different models of inhibitory control have been put forward (e.g., Aron et al.  ,  ; Swick and Chatham  ; Van Belle et al.  ; Zandbelt et al.  ; Hampshire et al.  , 2015). Among these models, those proposed by Aron and Hampshire are arguably the most prominent and influential. Aron and colleagues proposed that response inhibition activated a module mainly in the right lateralized frontal brain areas, in which the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was the key component. During intact response inhibition, inhibitory neural stop signals may then be sent from these frontal regions to the motor cortices through cortico-striatal\u2013thalamic\u2013cortical projections (Aron  ; Chambers et al.  ). Hampshire\u2019s group, on the other hand, suggested that response inhibition was one example of a broader class of control processes. These control processes are supported by the same set of fronto-parietal networks that exert control by modulating local lateral inhibition processes, which occur ubiquitously throughout the cortex (Hampshire et al.  ). Thus, instead of focusing on how a specific brain region and its connection pathways may support response inhibition, understanding the neural basis of behavioral control may require a more holistic approach that considers how common network mechanisms support diverse cognitive processes (Hampshire and Sharp  ).   \nNumber of studies investigating the neural correlates of response inhibition using fMRI over the last 15\u00a0years (1 Jan. 2001\u201331 Dec. 2015). Two databases\u2014PubMed and Web of Science\u2014were searched using the keywords \u201cresponse inhibition\u201d and \u201cfMRI\u201d \n  \n\nThe previous studies have indicated common regions activated by response inhibition tasks, including those correlates comprising the fronto-parietal network, specifically the IFG, pre-SMA, and parietal regions. For example, Sebastian et al. ( ), using hybrid tasks combining Simon, Go/NoGo, and stop signals, demonstrated that areas such as the IFG and the bilateral parietal regions showed activation across all tasks. Nonetheless, unique neural networks for the three subcategories of processes underpinning response inhibition have also been suggested (Rubia et al.  ; Sebastian et al.  ; Chevrier et al.  ; van Velzen et al.  ; Sebastian et al.  ). For example, the Simon task (interference resolution) was found to stimulate the pre-motor and parietal regions to a greater extent than action cancellation (stop signals), whereas action cancellation was found to elicit stronger activation in the bilateral posterior inferior frontal gyrus/insula and the right striatum than action withholding (Go/NoGo) (Sebastian et al.  ). Although the above findings provide important preliminary evidence of the potential common and distinct neural underpinnings of different response inhibition tasks, the majority of studies have either explored only a single response inhibition task in small samples with limited statistical power or were challenging to compare, because they employed various different stimuli (e.g., visual, auditory). We are, therefore, hindered from drawing complete conclusions on the common and distinct neural correlates of the subcategory of processes for response inhibition (Swick et al.  ; Logan et al.  ). An understanding of the common and unique neural correlates of the subcategories of cognitive processes associated with response inhibition provides critical insight into early detection, diagnostic accuracy, and treatment targets of clinical disorders afflicted by dysfunctional response inhibition (Aron  ; Chambers et al.  ). Meta-analytic pooling of all related studies is a powerful statistical tool that combines data sets from a collection of similar studies to obtain a more accurate and robust estimate of the effect size of a given phenomenon (Fox et al.  ), and thus may serve as a promising approach to studying the common and distinct neural correlates of the three subcategories of processes associated with response inhibition. \n\nFurthermore, investigation of network correlated activations may provide system-level interpretations as to what neural mechanisms underlie response inhibition (Damoiseaux et al.  ; Smith et al.  ; Erika-Florence et al.  ). Indeed, studies have suggested that response inhibition is correlated with the connections between the cingulo-opercular network (salience network) and fronto-parietal network, and that default mode network activity might be actively downregulated by an inhibitory module within the fronto-parietal network (Leech et al.  ). Aberrant network interactions are proposed to lead to deficits in response inhibition (Hampshire and Sharp  ; Jilka et al.  ). A large-scale network approach will help to clarify these speculations and provide system-level understanding about the working principle of response inhibition (Leech and Sharp  ). Given that response inhibition is subserved by a large-scale distributed system that includes the bilateral cortical and subcortical regions (Swick et al.  ), conceiving of a large-scale network rather than the classical region-based functional-anatomy analysis will be more suitable for this purpose (Woo et al.  ; Hampshire and Sharp  ). \n\nIn summary, the overall objective of this study is to provide a quantitative summary of the major findings across studies on response inhibition, on the basis of previously reported neural network parcellations (Yeo et al.  ; Choi et al.  ). Specifically, we aimed to (1) examine activation patterns across all studies using multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA); (2) analyze the brain functional network correlates responsible for interference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation; and (3) identify the common and primary neural network correlates for each subcategory through conjunction and subtraction analyses, respectively. \n\n\n\n## Methods and materials \n  \n### Literature search and selection criteria \n  \nTwo online citation indexing services\u2014PubMed and Web of Science\u2014were searched. Keywords including \u201cfMRI\u201d with \u201cresponse inhibition\u201d, \u201cinhibitory control\u201d, \u201cinterference resolution\u201d, \u201caction withholding\u201d, \u201caction cancellation\u201d, \u201cstop signal\u201d, \u201cstopping\u201d, \u201cgo nogo\u201d, \u201caction restraint\u201d, or \u201ccountermanding\u201d were used to retrieve relevant literature published prior to Dec. 31, 2015 (for detailed search results, please see Table S1 of the Supplementary Materials). We also searched the BrainMap database using Sleuth ( ) within the imaging modality of \u201cfMRI\u201d and the behavioral domain of \u201caction inhibition\u201d and obtained 106 papers. All articles were pooled into a database, and redundant entries were eliminated, yielding 4092 reports. We applied the following exclusion criteria to eliminate articles that were not directly relevant to this study: (1) nonoriginal studies (e.g., review articles), (2) studies that did not report results in standard stereotactic coordinate space (either Talairach or the Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI), (3) studies that were purely based on region of interest (ROI) analysis (e.g., using anatomical masks or coordinates from other studies), (4) analyses applying methods other than nonlinear modeling, e.g., multi-variate pattern analysis (MVPA), (5) studies with sample size below five and/or age range of participants outside 18\u201365\u00a0years, (6) studies on atypical populations whose brain functions may have deviated from those of healthy adults and those in which results for healthy controls were not reported separately, (7) pharmacological or training-related studies, and (8) single-sex studies. A total of 225 full articles were included in the current meta-analysis (Demographic data see Table S2 of Supplementary Materials). The detailed searching and selection procedures are shown in Fig.\u00a0 .   \nFlowchart of searching and selection of literature in response inhibition \n  \n\n\n### Experiment categorization \n  \n#### Interference resolution \n  \nInterference resolution is the process of selecting information with regard to its relevance to an ongoing task and suppressing the processing of irrelevant information (Yarkoni et al.  ). This process can be captured by stimulus response incompatibility tasks, such as the Stroop, Simon, Flanker, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test paradigms (Stahl et al.  ; van Velzen et al.  ). We examined the brain activation profiles of participants who performed these tasks to understand the neural activity underpinning interference resolution. On the behavioral level, for example, Stroop and Flanker are similar in that both require the ability to control stimulus-related interference as well as the ability to control response-related interference (Stahl et al.  ). On the neural level, for example, Liu et al. ( ) found that both tasks activated brain regions that serve as a source of attentional control, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior regions that are sites of attentional control, such as the visual processing stream (the middle occipital and inferior temporal cortices). Our analyses suggested that no specific paradigms disproportionately altered the results (Table\u00a0  and Fig. S1 in Supplementary Materials). Thus, 50 articles consisting of 68 experiments with 817 foci were included to explore the neural correlates of interference resolution. The characteristics of each study are listed in Table S2 of the Supplementary Materials. \n\n\n#### Action withholding \n  \nGo/NoGo paradigms require individuals to rapidly respond to pre-defined \u201cGo\u201d stimuli while withholding responses to pre-defined \u201cNoGo\u201d stimuli presented in random sequence, and thus, they are classified as eliciting action withholding. A measure of action withholding is the proportion of inhibited stimuli (\u201cNoGo\u201d trials) relative to noninhibited stimuli (Go trials) (van Velzen et al.  ). The effects of such \u201cNoGo\u201d frequency should be considered as low frequency. \u201cNoGo\u201d signals have been found to engage significant attention resources (Criaud and Boulinguez  ). Different contrast conditions for Go/NoGo tasks exist, e.g., \u201cNoGo\u201d trials vs. \u201cGo\u201d trials and \u201cNoGo\u201d vs. fixation cross as baseline (e.g., van Rooij et al.  ) or a low-level baseline (e.g., Claus and Hendershot  ). We compared experiments with high frequency of \u201cNoGo\u201d stimuli to those with low frequency (i.e., equal to 50% and less than 50%, respectively). We found that the network correlate distributions of activated areas were not significantly different (Table S6 and S7 in Supplementary Materials). Thus, 117 articles using the Go/NoGo paradigm and comprising 147 contrasts were employed to identify the action withholding-related activation patterns. \n\n\n#### Action cancellation \n  \nWe classified stop signal tasks as those that trigger action cancellation (Aron et al.  ; Schachar et al.  ). Stop signal paradigms consist of two concurrent tasks, i.e., a go task and a stop task. In a stop signal task, individuals are instructed to make rapid choices about target stimuli. In some trials, a second stimulus (e.g., auditory) is presented shortly after the target, and individuals need to cancel their response, which has often been initiated already. Thus, the demand for response inhibition is high, because the stop signals are randomly presented in an array of go trials. Participants are instructed to cancel their initiated actions when the stop signals are presented. The design of the task is to ensure inhibition of approximately 50% of the go responses following a stop signal. Since the most appropriate comparison conditions for stop signal tasks have been debated in the literature (Boehler et al.  ; Swick et al.  ), we did a Chi-square test and found that the network correlates distribution between all contrasts, and contrasts that only included the stop\u2013go paradigm did not differ at a significant level (detailed condition comparisons of each stop signal task and the results are presented in Table S8 in the Supplementary Materials). Seventy-three related articles with 108 stop signal experiments were included in this meta-analysis to summarize the activation patterns of action cancellation. \n\n\n\n### Data extraction \n  \nWe extracted the following information from each study: authors, year of publication, sample size, experimental design, paradigms and task contrasts (including the frequency of the presented inhibitory stimuli), field strength of the MRI scanner, and cluster coordinates in the MNI or Talairach space (Table S2 in Supplementary Materials). As the MNI/Talairach coordinate bias associated with reference frame (position and orientation) and scale (brain size) can be substantially reduced using the best-fit tal2icbm transform (Lancaster et al.  ), coordinates that were not reported in the MNI space were transformed using the Lancaster transformation. \n\n\n### Multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) \n  \nWe conducted meta-analyses using the MKDA (Wager et al.  ) toolbox ( ) to identify brain regions activated during response inhibition. Peak effect coordinates from each study were convolved with a spherical kernel (  r  \u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0mm) and threshold to obtain an indicator map, with a value of one indicating a significant effect in the neighborhood and a value of zero indicating no significant effect. The density of the effect was computed by averaging the indicator maps weighted by the study sample size, and the resulting density maps showed the proportion of studies in which activation was observed within 5\u00a0mm of each voxel. The family wise error (FWE) rate was estimated with a Monte Carlo simulation to correct for multiple comparisons, and a natural null hypothesis was that the \u201cactivated\u201d regions are randomly distributed throughout the brain. Thus, the reported meta-analytic results in this study represent consistently activated regions across studies: regions in which significant activations were observed in the local neighborhood by more studies than would be expected by chance (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected across the entire brain). The MKDA was performed for characterizing brain activation patterns. First, we identified those brain regions that showed significant convergence across 225 studies comprising 3453 foci from 323 contrasts. Then, three additional MKDA analyses were conducted for the specific activations produced by the three subcategories: interference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation. For interference resolution, 817 foci from 68 contrasts were included. The analyses for action withholding consisted of 1932 foci from 147 contrasts, and the analyses for action cancellation included 1523 foci from 108 contrasts. The same statistical analyses and thresholding approaches were applied for all meta-analyses in this study. Three subtraction analyses were conducted to capture the selectively or preferentially activated brain regions for the different classifications of responses: interference resolution vs. action withholding, interference resolution vs. action cancellation, and action withholding vs. action cancellation. \n\n\n### Activation patterns from the functional network correlate perspective \n  \nTo examine the related neural network correlates, voxels significantly activated by response inhibition and its sub-processes were overlaid onto seven commonly referenced brain functional network correlates covering the cerebral cortex and striatum (Yeo et al.  ; Choi et al.  ): the fronto-parietal network (FPN), dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), somatomotor network (SMN), visual network (VN), affective network (AFN), and default mode network (DMN). Chi-square tests were performed to contrast the proportions of the activated voxels in the seven network correlates distributed among interference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation. \n\n\n### Effect of contrast numbers \n  \nAction withholding (147 experiments of Go/NoGo tasks) and action cancellation (108 experiments of stop signal tasks) included approximately two times the number of experiments as interference resolution (68 experiments). Random selections of 68 contrasts from action withholding and action cancellation were performed to test the effect of the experiment numbers. We repeated the MKDA analysis using the same settings, and Chi-square analyses were performed to compare the activated voxels in the seven network correlates to those of our main analyses and the random selected studies. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Meta-analysis of all included response inhibition experiments \n  \nThe all-inclusive analysis of the 225 studies showed significant activations of three large clusters in the right hemisphere: the frontal cortex, the angular gyrus, and the supplementary motor area (Fig.\u00a0 a and Table S3 in Supplementary Materials). More precisely, cluster activations in the frontal cortex included the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus. These activations extended to the subcortical regions (the thalamus and pallidum). Furthermore, activation of the angular gyrus cluster extended to the superior temporal gyrus, while activation of the supplementary motor area extended to the middle frontal gyrus. In addition, several areas in the left hemisphere, including the insula, putamen, and middle frontal gyrus were consistently activated across all response inhibition tasks. By overlapping these clusters with the seven functional networks, we discovered that the activated areas were primarily distributed in the fronto-parietal network (36%), ventral attention network (27%), dorsal attention network (18%), and default mode network (13%) (Table S9 in Supplementary Materials) (Fig.\u00a0 a).   \nConcordance of brain activation from the MKDA analyses.   a   Brain areas activated by all contrasts.

Based on the reported characterizations of functional neural networks, these clusters appeared to be located at the ventral attention network (45%), the dorsal attention network (27%), and the fronto-parietal network (20%) (Table\u00a0 ; Fig.\u00a0 b).   \nBrain areas significantly activated during interference resolution [  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, family wise error (FWE) corrected across the entire brain] \n  \nMaximum   P   is the maximum proportion of studies exhibiting the effect at the peak density weighted by sample size.

The activations were distributed in the fronto-parietal network (39%), the ventral attention network (28%), the dorsal attention network (14%), and the default mode network (15%) (Fig.\u00a0 c).   \nBrain areas significantly activated during action withholding (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected across the entire brain) \n  \nThe maximum   P   is the maximum proportion of studies exhibiting the effect at the peak density weighted by the sample size.

The activation distribution included the fronto-parietal network (35%), the ventral attention network (38%), the default mode network (16%), and the dorsal attention network (8%) (Fig.\u00a0 d).   \nBrain areas significantly activated during action cancellation (  p  \u00a0<\u00a00.05, FWE corrected across the entire brain) \n  \nThe maximum   P   is the maximum proportion of studies exhibiting the effect at the peak density weighted by the sample size.

The common regions included the right inferior frontal gyrus, which extended to the insula, right median cingulate, and paracingulate gyri, and the right superior parietal gyrus (Fig.\u00a0 ). The network analysis showed that the common activated areas were mostly distributed in the ventral attention network (61%), fronto-parietal network (26%), default mode network (8%), and dorsal attention network (4%).   \nCommon areas among different classifications of response inhibition.

Furthermore, we observed that interference resolution, which was related to greater activation in the ventral and dorsal attention networks (Fig.\u00a0 a, b), involved the left supplementary area, the left precentral gyrus, and the left superior parietal gyrus. On the other hand, action withholding engaged the fronto-parietal network, including regions of the right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral insula, the right triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, and subcortical areas such as the left putamen and right pallidum (Table\u00a0 ; Fig.\u00a0 c, d).   \nDirect contrasts of brain activations among the different classifications of response inhibition.   a   and   c   Different regions (neural network correlates) of interference resolution (IR) contrasted with action withholding (AW).   b   and   d   Different regions (neural network correlates) for interference resolution (IR) contrasted with action cancellation (AC).   e   and   f   Different regions (neural network correlates) for action withholding (AW) in contrast with action cancellation (AC).

Brain areas in bilateral insula and the right caudate showed greater activation during action withholding than action cancellation (Fig.\u00a0 e). \n\n\n### Validation analysis \n  \nThe results obtained in this study were proven replicable under different validation schemes. (1) Using the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, we tested the effects of excluding paradigms on interference resolution and found that the neural networks of interference resolution were primarily distributed in the ventral attention network and the dorsal attention network regardless of which paradigm was excluded (Table\u00a0 : Table S9 and Fig. S1 in Supplementary). (2) When examining the NoGo vs. Go contrast in relation to action withholding, activation of the correlates of the ventral attention network and the fronto-parietal network was observed (detailed brain areas are listed in Table S7 in Supplementary Materials). (3) With regard to the contrast condition of the stop signal tasks, we found no significant differences in the distribution of neural networks, including all studies and Stop versus Go contrasts (Table\u00a0  and Table S8 in Supplementary Materials). (4) The evaluation of the number of experiments when contrasting the three subcategories indicated no significant differences among the real contrasts and the randomly selected 68 contrasts for action withholding and action cancellation (Table\u00a0 ).

Independent of the task type, brain areas including the right inferior frontal gyrus extending to the insula, the right median cingulate, and paracingulate gyri, and the right superior parietal gyrus were activated across all paradigm classes. This observation is in line with the finding of previous meta-analytic studies on the topic (e.g., Cieslik et al.  ). By mapping the activated patterns onto the functional network atlas (Yeo et al.  ; Choi et al.  ), we found that the fronto-parietal network and the ventral attention network were the core neural systems engaged during response inhibition. Contrast analyses aiming to elucidate the unique neural substrates for each subcategory revealed that interference resolution, relative to action withholding/cancellation, produced stronger activation in the ventral attention network (the left supplementary area, precentral gyrus, and superior parietal gyrus). Furthermore, relative to action cancellation, action withholding primarily recruited the fronto-parietal network. On the other hand, relative to action withholding, action cancellation activated both the ventral attention and fronto-parietal networks. Overall, our results indicate common and unique neural activation patterns for the three subcategories of processes associated with response inhibition. \n\n### Common neural networks \n  \nThe fronto-parietal network is characterized as a set of cortical areas that are mutually activated when performing a wide variety of cognitively demanding tasks (Fedorenko et al.  ; Duncan  ). In this study, we found that across all 225 studies with 323 experiments, areas in the dorsal lateral frontal cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, and temporal parietal junction were consistently activated during all response inhibition tasks (Fig.\u00a0 a), i.e., activation was mainly distributed in the fronto-parietal network. Notably, similar results were also detected when input contrast counts were taken into account (Tables S5, S9), which demonstrated that the neural network involved in response inhibition was stable and robust. These findings are in line with the findings of previous studies on the neural correlates of working memory, sustained attention, and reasoning. Nee et al. ( ) reported that there was widespread bilateral fronto-parietal network activation during various types of working memory tasks. Similarly, consistent involvement in a very similar network was also observed in a study of the neural correlates of sustained attention (Langner and Eickhoff  ). By synthesizing semantic and visuospatial analogy tasks, Hobeika et al. ( ) observed that there were domain-oriented regions in the inferior and middle frontal gyri. Thus, domain-oriented regions within the fronto-parietal network are widely involved in cognitive control components including response inhibition, working memory, sustained attention, and reasoning (Miyake et al.  ; Chan et al.  ). \n\nBy overlapping the neural activity pattern of each category of response inhibition tasks, three main clusters of activation were observed at the (1) right IFG extending to insula, (2) right median cingulate and paracingulate gyri, and (3) right superior parietal gyrus (Fig.\u00a0 ). The right IFG, besides detecting changes in stimulus features (Sharp et al.  ; Dodds et al.  ), facilitates infrequent action-related events by activating nondominant but relevant responses while inhibiting automatic but irrelevant actions at the same time. Along this line of thought, lesion studies have also indicated that stop signal task performance worsens as the size of an inferior frontal gyrus lesion increases (Aron et al.  ), which supports an inhibitory role of the inferior frontal gyrus in resolving conflicts during response execution. The right anterior insula has been proposed to represent a hub that controls brain activity across different tasks and stimulus modalities to initiate and adjust cognitive control mechanisms (Cai et al.  ). The previous research has demonstrated a linear relationship between the neural activity of the anterior insula and task performance across three response inhibition tasks (Flanker, Go/NoGo etc.) (Wager et al.  ), which were included in the current meta-analysis. With respect to the right median cingulate and paracingulate gyri (MCG), studies have revealed that the MCG is the key region for proactive rather than reactive action control, indicated by increased neural activity for endogenous action selection (Aron  ). Notably, higher MCG activity was observed when subjects were required to perform a dual task, e.g., deciding which hand will perform the action and when to give the response (Hoffstaedter et al.  ,  ). Moreover, the MCG has also been implicated in performance monitoring via conflict detection in information processing, reallocation of attentional resources according to task-relevant information, and corresponding action formation (Badzakova-Trajkov et al.  ). Friedman and Miyake   indicated that subjects might experience several different mental processes during response inhibition tasks: maintaining the stimulus, which requires appropriate response in working memory; detecting conflicts for stimuli inconsistent with the goal; overcoming preponderant tendencies; and choosing correct responses. \n\nBased on the previous findings and the current results on the common areas involved in different response inhibition tasks, we argue that when performing these tasks, individuals need to maintain task requirements across trials and goal-corresponding action inhibition through engagement of the right IFG. In contrast, the right insula is required to overcome preponderant tendencies, notice the salient stimuli, and coordinate various control mechanisms. Finally, the right MCG is engaged in monitoring conflicts so as to promote task-relevant actions. Overall, we propose that the right inferior frontal gyrus, insula, and MCG may comprise the core neural network of the supervisory attentional control system needed to implement a nondominant, context-dependent behavior against a competing behavioral alternative (Alexander and Brown  ; Cieslik et al.  ). \n\n\n### Distinct neural networks \n  \nOur findings show that distinct neural correlates and hence networks were indicated for each of the three subcategories of processes: inference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation. Interference resolution was found to draw on the ventral attention network, while fronto-parietal network was implicated in action withholding/cancellation. \n\nIn this meta-analysis, the experimental paradigms classified as evoking interference resolution were those that required conflict resolution and inhibition of response tendencies for successful responding (Nee et al.  ). These paradigms induce an automatic attention reorientation and response preparation in the direction of the dominant but task-irrelevant stimuli. Participants then need to actively reorient attention to the nondominant spatial location to initiate an adequate response. This process may require enhanced consideration of the objective and engagement of resources for conflict management. Thus, inference resolution, relative to action inhibition, may draw upon significant coherent activation in the ventral attention network, especially the left pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and the left superior parietal gyrus. Pre-SMA is associated with monitoring and selecting appropriate motor response output (Nachev et al.  ; Iannaccone et al.  ) and the superior parietal gyrus has an essential role in re-directing attention by promoting attention allocation to nonspatial properties of stimuli (Mevorach et al.  ; Wang et al.  ). Overall, stronger ventral attention network activation during interference resolution compared to action inhibition may indicate that the former is to a greater extent dependent on response selection processes modulated by goals and conflicts (Nee et al.  ). \n\nAction withholding encompasses future action selection and inhibition, whereas action cancellation goes beyond this to demand inhibition of an ongoing response. This is induced by presenting Go and NoGo signals at the same time point in their respective trials for withholding or presenting stop signals with a delay after a Go signal for cancellation of an already initiated response. The inhibitory load is likely to be higher in cancellation than withholding (Schachar et al.  ). Studies have suggested that the time difference in presenting the NoGo and stop signals induces distinct activation patterns (Swick et al.  ; Rubia et al.  ), such as a greater extent of activation in the right inferior and superior frontal gyri. This notion is partially supported by the results of our subtraction analysis between action withholding and action cancellation (Table\u00a0 ). The activation differences observed between these two processes suggest that action withholding and cancellation may interact at different times within the action generation or action inhibition process, thus jointly influencing motor response inhibition (Sebastian et al.  ; Dambacher et al.  ; Cieslik et al.  ). \n\nFurther supporting the notion of time sequence difference between action withholding and action cancellation, Sebastian et al. ( ) used a hybrid response inhibition task to study functional and spatial segregation and the specialization of underlying neural sub-processes of response inhibition and found that neural activity levels in the fronto-parietal network follow a quantitative progression: action cancellation\u00a0>\u00a0action withholding\u00a0>\u00a0interference resolution. Three stages of general information processing exist: stimulus identification, response selection, and response execution, or the motor stage. The neural resource required increased gradually when progressing through these three stages of general information processing (Schank  ; Marois and Ivanoff  ). Herein, the progressive increase of neural activations by interference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation may imply that response inhibition may contain subcomponents that interact in a sequential fashion; action withholding is an intermediate process within the sequence of interference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation (Sebastian et al.  ,  ). \n\nNotably, action inhibition compared to interference resolution also engages neural networks in the striatum areas, such as the putamen and pallidum. The role of subcortical areas in response inhibition has extensively been discussed (see reviews: Aron  ; Deffains et al.  ; Aron et al.  ). Lesion studies also suggest that lesions of the medial striatum in rodents lead to overall longer stop signal reaction time (Eagle and Robbins  ). In line with these animal findings, patients with damaged basal ganglia are slower to stop their responses than controls (Rieger et al.  ). Furthermore, Go/NoGo tasks also elicit striatal activation. Many functional and structural MRI studies have pointed to a fronto-striatal \u201ccircuit\u201d underlying response inhibition in the Go/NoGo paradigm (Durston et al.  ; Wessa et al.  ). In a neurophysiological experiment, striatal activity was recorded, while monkeys were performing a Go/NoGo task. The authors found that the striatum could be important for preparing to stop a response (under working memory) and then implementing inhibitory control over a sustained period (Apicella et al.  ). Thus, the neural activity pattern in the striatum plus the frontal areas comprises a cortical circuit related to the control of response inhibition, specifically response execution (Aron  ). \n\n\n### Implications \n  \n#### General implication \n  \nIn the time of cognitive neuroscience 2.0, ongoing effort is being made to develop a comprehensive cognitive atlas that defines a set of mental constructs along with a set of mental tasks and the measurement relations between those classes (Yarkoni et al.  ; Poldrack et al.  ). Along these lines, one effort is an increased focus on formal synthesis of the cognitive neuroscience literature using meta-analyses to establish commonalities and dissociations across tasks (Yarkoni et al.  ). Examining whether different tasks engage shared or distinct neural correlates enhances our knowledge of the assumptions of mapping neural and mental activity and further advances our understanding of the ontology. \n\nSeveral meta-analyses have contributed a lot in advancing our knowledge of response inhibition and its neural correlates (Simmonds et al.  ; Swick et al.  ; Criaud and Boulinguez  ; Nee et al.  ; Buchsbaum et al.  ; Cieslik et al.  ). These studies are limited, however, in that they focus on a single subcategory of response inhibition (e.g., action withholding using the Go/NoGo task only in Simmonds et al.  ), included a small sample size (Criaud and Boulinguez  ; Simmonds et al.  ; Buchsbaum et al.  ), failed to compare subcategories directly (Nee et al.  ), or used a less reliable version of GingerALE (Eickhoff et al.  ). Simmonds et al. ( ), for example, included only 11 studies in their meta-analysis. It has been suggested that the replicability of meta-analyses including less than 30 studies is limited, and the conclusions drawn may, therefore, be questionable (Eickhoff et al.  ). Moreover, Nee et al. ( ) reported that unique neural activity patterns were associated with different response inhibitions tasks, but they did not compare these tasks to each other. Furthermore, the use of an early version of GingerALE (e.g., Swick et al.  ; Simmonds et al.  ), which has had reported implementation errors, may lead to false positives due to the overly liberal statistical results during multi-comparison tests (Eickhoff et al.  ). Our meta-analysis addresses these limitations and provides an updated quantitative meta-analytic review of the current neuroimaging literature using a dedicated updated algorithm, thus further advancing our knowledge on the neural correlates of response inhibition. \n\nThrough synthesizing data from different tasks tapping into response inhibition, we found that brain areas such as the right inferior frontal gyrus and anterior insula, which are distributed throughout the fronto-parietal network, as well as areas such as the right MCG in the ventral attentional network, are commonly activated in all of the tasks which we included. This suggests that response inhibition is one core component of cognitive control, and its neural correlates may also co-exist with other components of cognitive control (Duncan  ). Meanwhile, subtraction analyses suggested that some specific neural correlates are involved in different categories of response inhibition tasks, which indicates that response inhibition is not a unidimensional construct. Instead, response inhibition could be a multidimensional construct consisting of multiple subcategories of cognitive processes, which recruit both common and distinct neural correlates, and hence neural networks. Sebastian et al. ( ) conducted a well-designed study that used a hybrid response inhibition task to demonstrate that the subcomponents of response inhibition included in the current meta-analysis (i.e., interference inhibition, action withholding, and action cancellation) intervened in the action generation process at different points in time to implement response inhibition, further supporting our findings. Further methodologically rigorous studies are needed to develop and validate measurement tools specific to each subcategory of the response inhibition process. \n\n\n#### Clinical implications \n  \nRegarding the core neural correlates of response inhibition, one implication is that individuals who are impaired in one kind of response inhibition task may also be impaired in other tasks, because common activations unite the different response inhibition tasks, such as within the right inferior frontal gyrus. Accordingly, individuals with motor action inhibition deficits may also demonstrate impairment in interference resolution. For example, a specific deficit in inhibiting proponent motor responses during the stop signal task (Mittner et al.  ) as well as cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task (Lynn et al.  ; Ganos et al.  ) was observed in methamphetamine abusers. Revealing the core neural correlates of response inhibition also provides new insights into cognitive training. Establishing specific training programs for specific components of response inhibition is generally difficult, and the incorporation of all aspects of the cognitive process into the training program is impractical. However, enhanced performance in one or two response inhibition tasks may improve the efficiency of the right inferior frontal gyrus-based inhibition process and produce long-term benefits that affect regulation across multiple response inhibition contexts. Thus, individuals may be able to begin with more manageable tasks and progress to the tasks that target the cognitive functions that contribute to dysfunctional inhibition in their daily lives. Moreover, specific neural correlates for each subcategory of response inhibition may also help us to identify phenotypes for mental disorders (Van Belle et al.  ), such as schizophrenia and ADHD. Schachar et al. ( ) conducted a successful trial using variations of the stop signal task to evaluate the convergence of action withholding and action cancellation and to determine whether ADHD was marked by a deficit in one or both of these executive control processes. Both action withholding and cancellation are impaired in ADHD individuals. Similar studies have begun to emerge (Johnstone et al.  ), and precise knowledge of the distinct profiles of response inhibition subcomponents will advance diagnostic accuracy. \n\n\n\n### Methodological considerations \n  \nWe acknowledge that our meta-analysis is subject to limitations. The first one is related to the bias of synthesizing different tasks into the components of interference resolution. Our meta-analysis included studies adopting a mixture of inhibitory control tasks, such as the Stroop, Simon, and Flanker tasks, with the consequence of increased heterogeneity of study paradigm and designs. We adopted the leave-one-out cross-validation method to test homogeneity and determined that all brain activation areas showed highly replicable network distribution profiles (Table S9; Figure S1 in Supplementary Materials). Nevertheless, future meta-analyses including additional studies with common stimulus\u2013response incompatibility tasks are needed. The second limitation is related to the use of the Go/NoGo task for action withholding. Go/NoGo can be classified as a simple task (the NoGo stimulus was always the same) or a complex task (the NoGo stimulus changed depending on context) that may require more frequent updating of stimulus\u2013response association in working memory (Simmonds et al.  ). As such, simple and complex Go/NoGo tasks may not be perfectly matched across the included studies. In line with this, it has been suggested that the activity pattern in the fronto-parietal network may be derived from the high demand placed on attentional or working memory resources (Simmonds et al.  ; Criaud and Boulinguez  ). However, such suggestions were derived from meta-analyses that included less than 30 experiments and thus may not be sufficiently robust (Eickhoff et al.  ). We compared high (simple) and low (complex) frequencies of NoGo stimulus (i.e., equal to 50% and less than 50%, respectively) and found that the network correlate distributions of activated areas did not differ significantly (Tables S6, S7, respectively, in the Supplementary Materials). Third, the use of the data generated from stop signal tasks to assess action cancellation drew more on proactive than reactive control for inhibiting inappropriate responses (Aron  ; Vink et al.  ; Van Belle et al.  ; Vink et al.  ). To control for this confounding effect, we have conducted a supplementary Chi-square test. The result of this test demonstrated that the network correlate distributions between all contrasts and those contrasts that included only the Stop\u2013Go tasks did not differ significantly (detailed condition comparisons of each stop signal task and the results are presented in Tables S2 and S9 in the Supplementary Materials). Nonetheless, despite the robust findings in this study, the heterogeneity of the action cancellation tasks should be a point of concern for future research. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn this meta-analysis, we examined the neural basis of three subcategories of cognitive processes underpinning response inhibition, namely interference resolution, response withholding, and response cancellation. We followed a neural network perspective with multi-kernel density analysis and reviewed studies employing tasks that require inhibition of inappropriate actions as well as concurrent initiation and execution of context-appropriate alternatives. Independent of the task types, activation of the right hemispheric regions (the IFG, insula, median cingulate, and paracingulate gyri) and the superior parietal gyrus was common across the cognitive processes studied. Mapping the activation patterns to a brain functional network atlas revealed that the fronto-parietal and the ventral attention network were the core neural systems commonly engaged during the different processes of response inhibition. Subtraction analyses elucidated the distinct neural substrates of interference resolution, action withholding, and action cancellation, and revealed stronger activation in the ventral attention network for interference resolution than action inhibition. On the other hand, action withholding/cancellation primarily engaged the fronto-striatal circuit. Overall, our results suggest that response inhibition is not a unidimensional construct but consists of subcategories of cognitive processes that engage common as well as distinct neural correlates and networks.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the association of MRI-determined intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid-rich necrotic core, and thinning/rupture of the fibrous cap with recurrent ischemic events. \n\n\n## Methods: \n  \nElectronic search was performed in PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to Oct 30, 2018. We included cohort studies with an average follow-up time of more than 1 month in which intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid-rich necrotic core, or thinning/rupture of the fibrous cap were associated with recurrent ipsilateral stroke or ischemic events. We performed heterogeneity assessment before carrying out meta-analysis. According to the heterogeneity, we selected fixed-effect model for meta-analysis of the included cohort studies. \n\n\n## Results: \n  \nUsing a prespecified search strategy, of the 2128 articles, 6 studies with a total number of 621 participants met eligibility for systematic review and meta-analysis. The hazard ratios of intra-plaque hemorrhage, thinning/rupture of the fibrous cap and lipid rich necrotic core as recurrent Stroke/Transient ischemic attack (TIA) were 7.14(95% confidence interval, 4.32 to 11.82), 5.68(95% confidence interval, 2.40 to 13.47), and 2.73(95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 7.16), respectively. No significant heterogeneity was found in the 3 meta-analyses. \n\n\n## Conclusions: \n  \nThe presence of intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid-rich necrotic core, and thinning/rupture of the fibrous cap on MRI of carotid plaque are strong predictors of recurrent stroke events. However, due to the lack of original studies, larger cohort studies are warranted. \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nStroke is the second most important cause of death in the world.  As one of the primary contributors to ischemic stroke, large-artery atherosclerosis has been commonly found in patients who suffered from ischemic stroke.  Previous studies have shown that the degree of carotid artery stenosis is a biological indicator to evaluate the occurrence of stroke events.  However, some studies have shown that carotid artery high-risk plaques are significantly correlated with cerebrovascular events.  The high-risk plaques are defined as a plaque with a large lipid necrotic core, intraplaque hemorrhage, or rupture of the plaque surface. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that the components of carotid atherosclerotic plaques that contribute to carotid artery stenosis might be well detected by magnetic resonance imaging and also used as a tool for predicting and assessing stroke risk.  MRI description of specific plaque components of IPH, LRNC, and TRFC could provide additional assessment and measurement for assessing the occurrence of stroke events.  Moreover, whether they could continue to be used as tools for predicting and evaluating the risk of recurrence of stroke events needs to be further confirmed. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that IPH, TRFC, and LRNC can be used as biological indicators to predict recurrent cerebral ischemic events.  However, MRI-determined plaque components and the study of recurrent ischemic events are relatively new projects. Individual studies are small, and the differences among various studies were unclear. In addition, whether there is a difference in the risk distribution of specific plaque components still remain unclear, such as intra-plaque hemorrhage (IPH), lipid rich necrotic core (LRNC), and thinning/rupture of the fibrous cap (TRFC). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to further confirm whether the components of carotid artery plaque can be used as an independent biological indicator to predict and evaluate the risk of stroke recurrence. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \nStudy design and implementation were based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. \n\n### Ethical review \n  \nEthical or board review approval was not required because this study did not include any human participants or animals. \n\n\n### Study registration \n  \nThe protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis has been registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with registration number CRD42019124043 on February 19, 2019. \n\n\n### Study eligibility criteria \n  \nWe included cohort studies, with language limited to English. Inclusion criteria were as follows: \n  \nEnglish language articles; \n  \nMRI of carotid vessel plaque composition; \n  \nmean follow-up >1 month; \n  \nassessment for development of recurrent ipsilateral stroke or recurrent TIA; \n  \ndesigned as prospective cohort study; \n  \nmeasuring any of the following plaque elements: IPH, LRNC, and TRFC. Eligible studies were up to all the inclusion standard. Case reports and reviews were excluded. \n  \nIn cases where outcome data was not clear, we attempted to contact the corresponding author for more specific details. \n\n\n### Information search and data collection \n  \nElectronic search were performed in PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to Oct 30, 2018. The reference list of previously published systematic reviews focusing on predicting the risk of stroke and eligible studies were searched. We manually retrieved conference proceedings and academic exchange summaries. We used the Mesh terms and keywords in combination: carotid artery, carotid plaque, atherosclerosis, stroke, recurrent, recurrence, ischemic events. The search strategy for PubMed is shown in Table   and this strategy also were used on other data databases. \n  \nSearch strategy used in PubMed. \n  \n\n### Data extraction \n  \nThe 2 reviewers independently extracted data for each eligible study: first author's last name, year of publication, country of origin, number of male and female patients, baseline risk factors, and adjusted HR results. Any differences were resolved by consensus. \n\n\n### Risk of bias assessment \n  \nTwo reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies with the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale (NOS) (Wells et al., 2009) for cohort studies, which consists of 3 parameters of quality: selection, comparability, and outcome assessment. The NOS assigns a maximum score of 4 for selection, 2 for comparability, and 3 for outcome. Hence, a score of 9 is the highest and reflects the highest quality. Discrepancies were addressed in consultation with the third one. \n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nAll studies that reported HR results or provided appropriate data which were obtained by Univariate Cox Regression analysis for HR calculation were selected for meta-analyses. Due to differences in study size, follow-up time, magnetic resonance imaging technique, and patient characteristics, we used a relatively conservative fixed-effect model to incorporate HR. Heterogeneity was measured using the   I   statistic, and the   I   statistic, this statistic yields results ranged from 0 to 100% (  I  \u200a=\u200a0%\u201325%, no heterogeneity;   I  \u200a=\u200a25%\u201350%, moderate heterogeneity;   I  \u200a=\u200a50%\u201375%, large heterogeneity; and   I  \u200a=\u200a75%\u2013100%, extreme heterogeneity. If there was very large heterogeneity between studies, subgroup analysis would be conducted according to magnetic resonance sequence. If heterogeneity existed, the random-effects model was used, otherwise, the fixed-effects model was used. In addition, funnel plots were also conducted to find a potential publication bias. We performed subgroup analyses of the IPH group and stratified them according to whether the multi-sequence carotid coil magnetic resonance technique was used. At the same time, the amount of studies reporting HR results of LRNC and TRFC was not enough for subgroup analyses, so we decided to use words to describe them. The number of studies included in the meta-analysis was insufficient for publication bias analysis. All data analyses were conducted by RevMan 5.3 (Review Manager (RevMan) [Computer program]. Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) software provided by Cochrane collaboration ( ) \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Study selection \n  \nA total of 2128 studies were retrieved through retrieval methods and related literatures, among which 14 literatures that met the inclusion criteria were selected through reading abstracts (OA_ Guidelines Flow Diagram). Among the 14 studies, 1 study was excluded due to the plaque components were obtained by histopathological analysis from endarterectomy and 3 studies were excluded due to the absence of specific effect size indicators that could not meet the requirements. In addition, 4 literatures were excluded due to the case-control studies did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 6 studies met eligibility for the systematic review. \n\n\n### Characteristics of included studies \n  \nAll 6 articles included in the selection criteria are prospective cohort studies (Table  ). The plaque characteristics of the 4 studies, the diagnostic criteria of IPH were consistent: the signal intensity of the plaque exceeded that of adjacent skeletal muscle by more than 50%.  Plaques in 2 studies were evaluated by specialized vascular wall analysis software.  All plaque analyses used Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis to explore the effect of plaque characteristics on the recurrence rate of cerebral ischemia (stroke, TIA or AmF). The results of the 6 studies (recurrent ischemic events) were recorded by clinical evaluators during follow-up, while all the recurrent strokes in 5 studies were confirmed by neuroimaging,  and 1 study was prospectively assessed by clinical investigators before follow-up.  All results were recorded by follow-up, which lasted more than 1 month. Two studies were followed up to clinical endpoint events (carotid endarterectomy or death).  Six studies included IPH in their results,  while 2 reported TRFC  and also 2 focused on LRNC.  For the 6 original studies, 4 studies performed in United Kingdom,  1 in China  and 1 in Netherlands.  The age of the population concerned in all the studies was 66 to 73, and male accounted for a large proportion in all the 7 articles (range, 64%\u201375%). The proportion of hypertension in the study population ranged from75% to 79% in 6 articles,  only 3 articles collected the proportion of heart disease patients  and the proportion of smokers in 6 articles ranged from 38% to 70%.  There were considerable differences in the degree of carotid artery stenosis collected in 6 articles: 3 studies focused on moderate to severe (\u226550%) stenosis ; 2 studies focused on mild to moderate (40% 70%) stenosis ; 1 study did not give information on the extent of carotid artery stenosis.  Three studies were from the same research group.  The time range and characteristics of the 3 studies were different, and there were no 2 or 3 studies covered by the same population. \n  \nOverview of patient characteristics in studies evaluating the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with carotid plaque MRI. \n  \nFive studies were performed on 1.5-T MRI, 1 study on 3.0-T MRI. In the IPH studies, 4 studies used multiple sequences to assess carotid plaque, and 2 studies used a separate standard carotid coil to detect IPH. In the original 6 studies, only 3 studies divided the results into ipsilateral stroke and ipsilateral TIA, whereas the remaining 3 studies did not distinguish the results.

Both evaluators agreed on the quality of the study. All the studies were of high quality. The most common selection bias were derived from the determination of exposure factors. In terms of comparability bias, all the studies included adequate matching or adjustments (eg, age, and sex). The most common exposure bias were due to lack of integrity of follow-up records. \n  \nQuality of selected literature. \n  \n\n### Meta-analysis results \n  \nAll the included studies met the criteria for systematic meta-analysis, including 6 studies evaluating IPH, 2 studies evaluating LRNC, and 2 studies evaluating TRFC. In the IPH-characterized group, a total of 621 patients were meta-analyzed. In the LRNC-characterized group, 189 patients were meta-analyzed. Finally, in the TRFC-characterized group, a total of 189 patients were meta-analyzed. No significant heterogeneity was noted in the 2 primary analyses. We found a significant positive relationship between IPH, LRNC, and TRFC and the risk of recurrent ischemic events (stroke plus TIA), with a fixed-effects HR of 7.14 (95% CI, 4.32\u201311.82), 2.73 (95% CI, 1.04\u20137.16), and 5.68 (95% CI, 2.40\u201313.67), respectively, for each specific plaque element (Figs.  \u2013 ).

In recent years, some studies have shown that the presence of carotid artery plaque characteristics can predict the occurrence of recurrent cerebral ischemic events.  However, at present, there is a lack of systematic evidence that the characteristic components of carotid artery plaques can predict the recurrence of cerebral ischemic events. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a meta-analysis to present systematic evidence. \n\nIn our meta-analysis, we found that carotid artery plaques with IPH, TRFC, or LRNC were more likely to contribute to recurrence of ipsilateral ischemic events. In this comprehensive meta-analyses of the characteristic components of carotid artery plaques and ipsilateral recurrent ischemic events, we found that HRs of IPH, TRFC, and LRNC ranged from 2 to 8, among which 6 studies could be used for IPH meta-analysis,  and only 2 original researches data could be used for TRFC and LRNC analysis.  Till now, this is the first systematic meta-analysis that evaluate the effect of IPH, TRFC, and LRNC on recurrent ischemic events. In our present study, the HRs of IPH, TRFC and LRNC, and recurrent ischemic events were 7.14, 5.68, and 2.73, respectively. In this meta-analysis, data from 6 original studies were included.  A total of 621 patients with carotid artery plaque who had follow-up records were included, among whom male patients accounted for 73%. \n\nHR for IPH was statistically significant when data analysis was limited to studies using multi-sequence or single-sequence carotid coil MRI. Meanwhile, the original studies on TRFC and LRNC were little, further subgroup analysis could not be achieved. \n\nIn our study, the HRs of IPH, TRFC, and LRNC were statistically significant, while no significant heterogeneity was found. In addition, the study revealed that the HR was the highest in the presence of IPH (7.14), while HR was the lowest in the presence of LRNC (2.73). In addition, and HR was in the middle of the 2 plaque components in the presence of TRFC (5.68). Meanwhile, the rank of HRs of the 3 plaques in the analysis results was different from that of the progression of plaque components. According to the AHA classification scheme, carotid artery plaque progression, and formation occur before the atherosclerosis and lipid composition of deposits, thus forming artery atheromatous plaque. Plaque bleeding can occur in stable plaques and then become unstable plaque, the unstable plaque has a greater risk for FC broken and damaged surface patches, eventually lead to the carotid artery embolism.  In 6 studies, only 2 studies investigated the effect of 2 or more plaque elements on recurrent ischemic events,  4 of which only studied IPH. None of the studies examined the significance of the 3 plaque elements in the composite plaque for the risk of recurrent ischemic events in a multi-parameter test. Moreover, no study separated TIA and Stroke from HRs of the 3 plaque elements, and only complex cerebral ischemic events related to HR of IPH, TRFC, and LRNC were finally obtained. Furthermore, the 6 studies did not further assess the possibility of a relationship between the temporal dynamics of plaque development and recurrent ischemic events. \n\nOur study also analyzed whether different MRI sequences of carotid artery plaques could be the cause of the difference between the HRs of IPH and the actual results. In order to accurately obtain the presence signs of IPH, various studies did not necessarily use the same MRI technology for detection. Among the 6 studies focusing on IPH, 4 studies only used separate gradient echo MRI sequences to detect and analyze the existence of IPH,  and 2 studies used multi-sequence MRI to analyze IPH.  After our analysis, there was no statistically significant heterogeneity between the 2 subgroups, suggesting that the existing evidence was more supportive of MRI sequence differences and did not have a substantial impact on IPH HR. However, further work needs to evaluate the practical application of the testing tools if more accurate evidence is to be obtained. At the same time, due to the lack of studies with evaluating TRFC and LRNC, further subgroup analysis cannot be carried out in a more detailed manner, and the obstacle of MRI carotid plaque imaging as a routine risk stratification tool cannot be known. \n\nSimilar to the previous studies on MRI in carotid artery plaque studies, our study also exists some limitations. First of all, there were differences in the reported results of various plaque components among various studies. Most studies used the comprehensive measurement of stroke, TIA and other cerebral ischemic events, so we could not more accurately determine the individual HR of stroke and TIA. Second, TRFC, LRNC researches were not enough and could not go a step further to subgroup analysis, also we did not know whether there was a significant variation in team of TRFC and LRNC plaque imaging of MRI technology, whether we needed to discuss the question of what kind of technology was more suitable for risk stratification, 1.5 T and 3 T machine on the different characteristics of plaque. Third, our study indicated that there was no significant variation in the MRI technique for plaque imaging in the IPH group, which was consistent with the results of previous studies on carotid artery plaque characteristics and stroke. Fourth, none of the studies reported the possibility that changes in the morphology and composition of plaques over time might be associated with subsequent recurrent ischemic events. There was a large variation in the time interval between the initial event and MR plaque imaging across selected studies. Plaque composition and morphology may have changed over time. Fifth, it is not clear how many patients suffered recurrent ischemic events beyond the follow-up time due to inconsistency among studies. Sixth, since many studies have included a wide range of stenosis patients, more accurate comprehensive risk estimates that consider stenosis and plaque characteristics need to include studies with less heterogeneity in stenosis degree. Seventh, differences and heterogeneity may arise due to different secondary prevention strategies, such as different drugs and blood pressure control applied in different studies in patients with ischemic events in the time period between the first episode and recurrence. Finally, most studies excluded patients who underwent surgical revascularization, and we could not rule out the absence of carotid plaque characteristics and risk of recurrent ischemic events in these patients, which introduces selection bias into non-randomized cohort studies. Of course, our study needs to be further improved by more original studies. \n\nIn summary, our present study indicated that MRI detection of specific plaque components such as IPH, TRFC, and LRNC could help us to screen out patients who had experienced the first stroke/TIA event and were more likely to have recurrent ischemic events. For lessons, unnecessary surgery should be avoided to prevent recurrent ischemic events provides guidance for patients to receive more effective preventive measures. \n\n\n## Author contributions \n  \n Conceptualization:   Kang Li, Qingjun Yang. \n\n Data analysis:   Fengbin Deng. \n\n Data curation:   Ling Yang, Changping Mu. \n\n Data extraction:   Ling Yang, Changping Mu. \n\n Formal analysis:   Fengbin Deng, Qingjun Yang. \n\n Investigation:   Fengbin Deng. \n\n Methodology:   Fengbin Deng, Huaqiang Li. \n\n Software:   Fengbin Deng, Huaqiang Li. \n\n Supervision:   Kang Li, Qingjun Yang. \n\n Writing \u2013 original draft:   Fengbin Deng, Changping Mu. \n\n Writing \u2013 review & editing:   Fengbin Deng, Changping Mu. \n\nKang Li orcid: 0000-0003-4637-6620. \n\n \n", "metadata": {"pmcid": 7220511, "text_md5": "e6cb779818183ee6568ec06f70a2b9c5", "field_positions": {"authors": [0, 112], "journal": [113, 133], "publication_year": [135, 139], "title": [150, 217], "keywords": [231, 308], "abstract": [321, 2125], "body": [2134, 22501]}, "batch": 2, "pmid": 32221065, "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000019377", "pmc_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7220511", "efetch_url": "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=7220511"}, "display_title": "pmcid: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7220511\">7220511</a>", "list_title": "PMC7220511  Carotid plaque magnetic resonance imaging and recurrent stroke risk"}
